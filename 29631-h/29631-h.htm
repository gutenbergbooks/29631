<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>This little work needs nothing from us to recommend
it to attention. In its incidents it presents
more that is keenly interesting, both to the
natural and to the spiritual feelings, than it would
have been easy to combine in the boldest fiction.
And then it is not fiction. The manner in which
the story is told leaves realities unencumbered, to
produce their own impression. It might gratify
the imagination, and even aid in enlarging our
practical views, to consider such scenes as possible,
and to fancy in what spirit a Christian might meet
them; but it extends our experience, and invigorates
our faith, to know that, having actually
taken place, it is thus that they have been met.</p>

<p>The first missionaries were wont, at intervals,
to return from their foreign labours, and relate to
those churches whose prayers had sent them forth,
&ldquo;all things that God had done with them&rdquo;
during their absence. To the Christians at Antioch,
there must have been important edification,
as well as satisfaction to their affectionate
concern about the individuals, and about the
cause, in the narrative of Paul and Barnabas.
Nor would the states of mind experienced, and the
spirit manifested, by the narrators themselves be
less instructive, than the various reception of
their message by various hearers. In these pages,
in like manner, Mr. Groves contributes to the
good of the Church, an important fruit of his
mission, were it to yield no other. He had cast
himself upon the Lord. To Him he had left it
to direct his path; to give him what things He
knew he had need of, and whether outward
prospects were bright or gloomy, to be the
strength of his heart and his portion for ever.
The publication of his former little Journal was
the erection of his Eben Ezer. Hitherto, said he
to us in England, the Lord hath helped me. And
now, after a prolonged residence among a people
with whom, in natural things, he can have
no communion, and who, towards his glad tidings
of salvation, are as apathetic as is compatible with
the bitterest contempt; after having had, during
many weeks, his individual share of the suffering,
and his mind worn with the spectacle, of a city
strangely visited at once with plague, and siege,
and inundation, and internal tumult; widowed,
and not without experience of &ldquo;flesh and heart
fainting and failing,&rdquo; he again &ldquo;blesses God for
all the way he has led him,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
tells us that &ldquo;the
Lord&#8217;s great care over him in the abundant provision
for all his necessities, enables him yet further
to sing of his goodness;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and while his situation
makes him say, &ldquo;what a place would this be to be
alone in now&rdquo; if without God, he adds, &ldquo;but with
Him, this is better than the garden of Eden.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
&ldquo;The Lord is my only stay, my only support; and
He is a support indeed.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It is remarkable, that at a time when the fear of
pestilence has agitated the people of this country,
and when the tottering fabric of society threatens
to hurl down upon us as dire a confusion as that
which has surrounded our brother, in a country
hitherto regarded so remote from all comparison
with our own; at a time when the records of the
seasons at which the terrible voice of God has
sounded loudest in our capital, are republished as
appropriate to the contemplation of Christians at
the existing crisis;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&mdash;this volume should have
been brought before the Public, by circumstances
quite unconnected with this train of God&#8217;s dealings
and threatenings to our land. The Christians
of Britain ought to consider, that there is a warning
voice of Providence, not only in the tumults of
the people, and in the terrors of the cholera
around them, but even in the publication of this
Journal. It is not for nothing that God has
moved Mr. Groves, as it were, to an advanced
post, where he might encounter the enemy before
them. The alarm may have, in a measure, subsided,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
but if the people of God are to be ever
patiently waiting for the coming of their conquering
King, this implies a patient preparedness for
those signs of his coming, the clouds and darkness
that are to go before him, in the very midst of
which they must be able to lift up their heads because
their redemption draweth nigh. To provide
for the worst contingencies is a virtue, not a
weakness, in the soldier. That Christian will not
keep his garments who forgets, that in this life, he
is a soldier always. No army is so orderly in peace,
or so triumphant upon lesser assaults, as that which
is ready always for the extremest exigencies of
war.</p>

<p>To those who are looking for the glorious appearing
of our great God and Saviour, Jesus
Christ, this volume will exhibit indications of the
advancement of the world towards the state in
which he shall find it at his coming. The diffusion
in the east of European notions and practices;
the desire on the part of the rulers to possess themselves
of the advantages of western intellect and
skill; and on the side of the governed, the conviction
of the comparative security and comfort of English
domination; the vastly increased intercourse between
those nations and the west, and the proposals
for still further accelerating and facilitating that
intercourse: all these things mark the rapid tendency,
of which we have so many other signs, towards
the production of one common mind throughout
the human race, to issue in that combination for
a common resistance of God, which, as of old,
when the people were one, and had all one language,
and it seemed that nothing could be
restrained from them which they had imagined to
do,&mdash;shall cause the Lord to come down and
confound their purpose. Already has this unity
of views and aims, with marvellous rapidity, prevailed
in the European and American world;
the press, the steam-engine by land and water,
the multiplication of societies and unions, portend
an advancement in it, to which nothing can
set limits but the intervention of God: and now
it appears that the mountain-fixedness of Asiatic
prejudice and institution shall suddenly be dissolved,
and absorbed into the general vortex.</p>

<p>And to those who may have suspected, that
the prospect of the return of Jesus of Nazareth
to our earth for vengeance and expurgation of
evil first, and then for occupation of rule,
<em>under</em> the face of the whole heaven, is but a
speculative subject for curious minds, this little
book presents matter of reflection. By circumstances
of such urgent personal concernment,
as those in which Mr. Groves and his departed
wife have been placed, the merely speculative
part of religion is put to flight. But we shall
find them in the midst of confusion, and bereavement,
and horror, clinging to this one hope for
themselves and for the world, that the Lord
cometh to reign, wherefore the earth shall be
glad; deriving from this hope a delight in God,
in the midst of all that seems adverse to such a
sentiment, which, if it be not a proof of practical
power in a doctrine, what is practical?</p>

<p>On some few points, Mr. Groves has given a
somewhat detailed expression of his own sentiments.
One of the most important of these is
re-considered in the notes by the writer of this
introduction. Another, on which the interest of
many has already been strongly excited, is the
recognition of those men as ministers of God,
who do not utter the word of his truth, and who
are admitted to speak without the Spirit of his
truth. The question, encompassed as it has been
with difficulties foreign to itself, is but a narrow
one. The preaching of the Gospel <em>is</em> an ordinance
of God. The preaching of what is not the
Gospel is <em>no</em> ordinance of God; and affords me
no opportunity of shewing my respect for divine
ordinances by my attendance upon it. That men
possessing the Holy Ghost should confer spiritual
gifts by the laying on of hands on those who in
faith receive it, <em>is</em> an ordinance of God: that men,
not having the Holy Ghost, should lay hands on
others for spiritual gifts, is <em>no</em> ordinance of God.</p>

<p>If the outward fact of what is named ordination,
determines me to regard as now made of
God a teacher, a pastor, an evangelist, a bishop,
him who, to all intelligent and spiritual perception,
is what he was, in error, and ignorance,
and carnality; this is not respect for divine ordinances
at all, but a faith in the <em>opus operatum</em>,
a faith in transubstantiation transferred to men,
denying the truth of my own perception, and
clinging to the conclusion of my superstition,
just as in the mass the senses are denied, and
bread and wine visibly unaltered, are called flesh
and blood. The arguments by which this notion
is supported, are too complicated, and too contemptuous
of unity or consistency, to be meddled
with in our limited space. That Christ bade men
observe what the Scribes and Pharisees taught
on the authority of the law of Moses, is made
a reason for reverencing what is taught on <em>no</em>
divine authority: Scribes and Pharisees, who
pretended to no divine ordination, but rested
their claims on their knowledge, are made
specimens of the respect due to ordination, in
the case of such whose ignorance and unsound
teaching are allowed. But were not the Scribes
and Pharisees in many things ignorant and unsound?
Yes, truly; but were these the things
of which the Lord said expressly, these things
observe and do? To tell us that we must
observe and do what is according to Scripture,
however bad the men who teach it, ordained
or unordained alike; what has this to do with
ordination? True, this is no excuse for those
who prostitute the form and name of God&#8217;s
ordinance, and know that it is prostituted: who
say, &ldquo;receive ye the Holy Ghost,&rdquo; and would
laugh as being supposed to confer the Holy
Ghost: but there is no necessity for running
from this crime, to the error of which we have
spoken. Let us acknowledge our wretchedness,
and misery, and poverty, and blindness, and
nakedness. When the laws were transgressed,
and the everlasting covenant broken; then the
<em>ordinance</em> was <em>changed</em>, as Isaiah foretold it
should,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> among the causes why the earth is
defiled under the inhabitants thereof.</p>

<p>The Apostolic Epistles contain little, if any
thing, to establish  the pastoral authority in a
single person of each church or congregation:
and the omission of all allusion to such an office
is often very remarkable from the occasion
seeming to assure us, that it would have been
mentioned had it existed. The Epistles of the
Lord to the seven churches are therefore resorted
to for proof of the existence and nature
of the place of a single pastor with peculiar and
exclusive powers. But neither there nor elsewhere
is the fact of ordination once referred to,
in relation to the receiving or rejection of those
who claimed to speak in the name of Christ.
In these very Epistles there is a commendation
for disregarding for the truth&#8217;s sake the highest
titles of ecclesiastical office. &ldquo;Thou canst not
bear them which are evil: thou hast <em>tried</em> them
which say they are apostles, and are not, and
hast found them liars.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
I believe, &ldquo;not to bear
them which are evil&rdquo; pastors, evangelists or
apostles, is as commendable in England as in Ephesus
in the eye of the Head of the Churches. Is
there a syllable in the Bible to lead us to suppose
that these liars were detected by any other
means than those which Paul had already taught
the Church? &ldquo;Though <em>we</em>, or an angel from
heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than
that which we have preached unto you, let him
be accursed.&rdquo; As for the ordinance, such passages
as Titus i. 9, make <em>selection</em> a part of
that ordinance: the bishop is to be one &ldquo;holding
fast the word of truth as he hath been taught.&rdquo;
Now, on what authority shall this part of the
ordinance, viz. selection, be omitted, and no flaw
follow: while the presence or omission of a manual
act in certain hands is to constitute the reality or
absence of Divine ordination?</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p style="margin-left: 30em;">
<em>Bagdad, April 2, 1830.</em></p>

<p>We begin to find that our school-room is not
large enough to contain the children, and we have
been obliged therefore to add to it another. We
have now fifty-eight boys and nine girls, and
might have many more girls had we the means for
instructing them; but we have as yet no other
help than the schoolmaster&#8217;s wife, who knows very
little of any thing, and therefore is very unfit to
bring those into order who have been educated without
any order. But I have no doubt of the Lord&#8217;s
sending us, in due time, sufficient help of all kinds.</p>

<p><em>April 3.</em>&mdash;An Armenian merchant from Egypt
and Syria, was with us to-day; a Roman Catholic
by profession, but an infidel in fact. He said it
was all one to him, whether men were Armenian,
Syrian, Mohammedan, or Jew, so that they were
good. He had left Beirout about two months,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
and said there were none of the missionaries
there then; but that he knew there the Armenian
Catholic bishop, and an Armenian priest,
who had left the Roman Catholic church, and
who were in Lebanon&mdash;he said they were friends
of his, and very good men. We feel interested
in receiving some missionary intelligence, to know
whether or not Syria is still deserted.</p>

<p>We have received from Shushee a parcel of
our Lord&#8217;s Sermon on the Mount, in the vulgar
Armenian. We were very much rejoiced at this,
as it enabled us to supersede, in some little degree,
the old language; but in determining that
every boy sufficiently advanced, should learn a
verse a day, we met with some opposition from
two or three of the elder boys, and I think two
will leave the school in consequence; but the Lord
will easily enable us to triumph over all; of this I
have no doubt, at all events I see my way clear
come what will. Captain Strong has taken a letter
for me to Archdeacon Parr, to ask for some
school materials, such as slates and slate pencils
for the school. I feel daily more established in
the conviction, that our Lord has led us to this
place, and that he will make our way apparent, as
we go on in faithful waiting upon him.</p>

<p>I cannot sufficiently thank God for sending my
dear brother Pfander with me, for had it not
been for him, I could not have attempted any
thing, so that all that has now been done, must
rather be considered his than mine, as I have only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
been able to look on and approve. But if the
Lord&#8217;s work is advanced, I can praise him by
whomsoever it may be promoted.</p>

<p><em>June 12.</em>&mdash;The circumstances of our situation
are now going on so regularly, that there is little
to write about, more than that the Lord&#8217;s mercies
are new every morning. Since Captain Strong
left us, there has arrived here a Mr. and Mrs.
Mignan, and another gentleman, named Elliot,
neither of whom seem to know, at present, whether
they will remain here or go on.</p>

<p>The capidji or officer, who came from Constantinople,
bringing a firman to the Pasha, is
desired to take back with him a drawing of one
of the soldiers whom Major T. is organizing for
the Pasha. Major T.&#8217;s son is just arrived from
India, and he also is going to organize a body of
horse; in fact, every thing is tending to the
establishment of an European influence, and it may
be the Lord&#8217;s pleasure thus to prepare the way
for his servants to publish the tidings which the
sheep will hear. This tendency to adopt European
manners and improvements, is not only manifested
in the military department, but in others
more important. The Pasha has a great desire
to introduce steam navigation on these two beautiful
rivers. A proposal has been made from an
agent of the Bristol Steam Company, to the
Pasha, through Major T., to have a steam vessel
in the first place between Bussorah and this place;
and secondly, if possible, to extend the navigation,
either by the old canal or by a new one, into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the Euphrates and up to Beer. This navigation
will bring one within three days of the
Mediterranean,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
without the fatigue, danger, and loss of
time to which travellers are exposed in the present
journey. It will be a most important opening
for missionaries; for should this mode of
conveyance once get established, the route by
Constantinople would almost cease, and some
arrangement would soon be made for going from
Scanderoon to the different important stations in
the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>There is a gentleman here on his return to
England, a Mr. Bywater, whom Mr. Taylor
wishes to undertake a survey of the Euphrates,
from Beer to the canal, which connects it
with this place. Till within about twenty years,
heavy artillery came to this place by that river, so
there can be but little doubt that a steam packet
would be able to go; though it might not be of the
same size as the one between this and Bussorah.
The voyage between these places backwards and
forwards, it is proposed to do in eight days, which
now takes about six or seven weeks, and during
the whole of the returning voyage, which is long,
being against the current, you are at present
exposed to the attacks of the Arabs every hour,
whereas the steam packet would have nothing to
fear from them. In fact, I feel the Lord is preparing
great changes in the heart of this nation, or
rather from one end of it to the other; and the
events which have taken place in that part of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
empire around Constantinople, have tended to the
hastening on of these changes.</p>

<p>Among the boys that come to me to learn English,
I have one, the son of a rich Roman Catholic
jeweller of this place. So important is the commercial
relation between this place and India become,
that the number who wish to learn English
of me, is much greater than I can possibly take
charge of, as this is not with me a primary object;
but it is a most important field of labour, and one
that might have, I think, very interesting results,
for they will bear opposition to their own views
more easily in another language than in their own:
it does not come to them like a book written to
oppose them, and thus truth may slide gently in.
My Moolah, who is teaching me Arabic, and
whose son I teach English, told me, that in two
or three years he would send his son to England
to complete his knowledge of English. Now to
those who know nothing of the Turks, this may
not appear remarkable, but to those who do, it
will exhibit a striking breaking down of prejudice
in this individual.</p>

<p>There is a famous man here, a Mohammedan by
profession, but in reality an infidel, who is the
head of a pantheistic sect, who believe God to be
every thing and every thing to be God, so that he
readily admits, on this notion, the divinity of our
blessed Lord. Infidelity is extending on every
side in these countries. My Moolah said, that
now a-days, if you asked a Christian whether he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
were a Christian, he would say, Yes; but if you
asked him who Christ was, or why he was attached
to him, he did not know. And in the
same manner he said, if you asked a Mohammedan
a similar question, he would also say, he did
not know, but that he went as others went; but,
he added, now all the <em>Sultans</em> were sending out
men to teach, the Sultan of England&mdash;the Sultan
of Stamboul, &amp;c. By this I imagine his impression
is, that we are sent out by the king of England.</p>

<p>Our school is, on the whole, going on very
well. We have introduced classes, and a general
table of good and bad behaviour, of lessons, of
absence, and of attendance; and they all go on,
learning a portion of Scripture every day in the
vulgar dialect. This is something.</p>

<p>I am beginning to feel my acquaintance with
Arabic increase under the plan which I am now
pursuing with the boys who learn English. They
bring me Arabic phrases, and as far as my knowledge
extends, I give them the meaning in English;
and when that fails, I write it down for
inquiry from the Moolah next day, and then by
asking words in Arabic every day for the boys to
give me the English, I at last get the expressions
so impressed on my memory, that when I want
them they arise almost without thought. Another
advantage from the boys bringing phrases and
words, is that they bring such as they use in the
spoken Arabic, which is very different from the
written. This is a plan I would recommend,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
whenever it can be adopted, to every missionary;
for there is a stimulus to the memory in having
the questions to ask every day, and having only the
English written down, which nothing else gives.</p>

<p>We have lately had a little proof of Turkish
honesty. The man who sells us wood, charged
us seven tagar, and brought us somewhat less
than three.</p>

<p>Our souls are much refreshed by the contemplation
of our Lord&#8217;s coming to complete the mystery
of godliness. Oh, how long shall it be, ere
he be admired in all them that believe.</p>

<p><em>June 26.</em>&mdash;We have heard to-day from Mrs.
G.&#8217;s brother J. from Alexander Casan Beg,
mentioned in a preceding part of my journal, and
from Mr. Glen. All our various accounts were
welcome. Some of the information contained in
them enables us to rejoice in those we love naturally,
some in those we love spiritually.</p>

<p>In the letters of Alexander C. Beg, and Mr.
Glen, I have received the intelligence that the
former would not now be able to join us, as he
had previously received an offer from the Scottish
Missionary Society, to become a missionary of
theirs in India; for certain reasons, however, he
does not at present seem able to accept it. Concerning
this Mohammedan convert, it is impossible
not to feel the deepest interest.</p>

<p>We have just had some interesting conversation
with a poor Jacobite, who is come from Merdin,
with a letter from his matran or bishop, about two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
churches which the Roman Catholics have taken
away from the Jacobites. His description of their
state is striking. He says, the Pasha of Merdin
cares neither for this Pasha, who is his immediate
superior, nor for the Sultan; and that he encourages
these disputes among the Christians, that
he may get money from both parties, who bribe
him by turns. He says, that the Yezidees, when
they see a Syrian priest coming, will get off their
horse and salute him, and kiss his hand, and that
the Kourds are a much worse people than they,
but that Roman Catholics are worse than either.&mdash;I
was surprised to find that the Roman Catholic
bishop has a school of fifty girls learning to read
Arabic, and to work at their needle.</p>

<p>We have heard to-day that the Mohammedans,
inhabitants of the town, are much dissatisfied
with the Sultan and with the Pasha, for introducing
European customs. They say, they are
already Christians, and one of them asked Mr.
Swoboda, if it was true that the old missid or
mosque near us, was to become again a Christian
church, and whether the beating of the drums
every evening after the European manner at the
seroy or palace, did not mean that the Pasha was
becoming a Christian. And they say, that the
military uniforms now introducing, are haram or
unlawful. Major T. has induced the Pasha to
have a regiment dressed completely in the European
fashion, and is now forming some horse regiments
on the same plan. All these things will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
clearly tend to one of these two results&mdash;either to
the overthrow of Mohammedanism by the introduction
of European manners and intelligence, or to
a tremendous crisis in endeavouring to throw off
the burden which the great mass of the lower and
bigoted Mohammedans abhor. But still the
Lord knows, and has given his angels charge to
seal his elect before these things come to pass.</p>

<p>Our attention has again been directed to the
subject of steam navigation between Bombay and
England, by the arrival of Mr. James Taylor from
Bombay. This gentleman has been engaged for
some time in undertaking to effect steam communication
by the Red Sea: with the view of making
final arrangements on the subject he had just
been to Bombay, and wished to have returned by
the Red Sea, but difficulties arising, he determined
to come by way of the Persian Gulf and
this city, and to cross the desert. On his arrival
here, he was made acquainted with the previous
plans for steam navigation on these rivers; and he
quickly perceived that if the river were navigable,
and no other difficulties arose, the preference
must be given to this route, as being at least ten
days shorter to Bombay, and of the thirty or
thirty-five days which remained, seven, or perhaps
five, would be spent on two beautiful rivers,
with opportunities of obtaining from its banks vegetables
and fruits; and instead of the Red Sea,
which is rocky, stormy, and little known, there
would be the Persian Gulf, which has been surveyed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
in every part, and is peculiarly free from
storms. From the mouth of the Persian Gulf,
the boat would go direct to Bombay instead of
going down to Columbo from the mouth of the
Red Sea, and then up the western side of the
Peninsula of India. In Egypt also they would
have five days journey over the desert, whilst
from Aleppo they would only have two to a place
on the Euphrates, called Beer. Fuel also in
abundance might be obtained here, either from
wood or bitumen; in fact, Mr. Taylor feels that
if it can be accomplished, it would save expense
on the voyage. The only two difficulties that oppose
themselves to this route are, first, the Arabs,
and secondly, whether there be a sufficiency
of water in the rivers. As to the Arabs, a
steamer has nothing to fear, for by keeping mid-stream
at the rate they go, no Arab would touch
them or attempt to do it. The present vessels
they have no power over in going down, but when
they are dragged up by Arab trackers, then they are
easily attacked. As to the second objection, the
want of water, there appears no insurmountable
difficulty here, as all the heavy ordnance from
Constantinople were brought down the Euphrates from
Beer, on rafts, or, as they are called, kelecks;
these, independent of their width, being greater
than that of a steamer, actually draw more water
when heavily laden. There does not appear to be
more than one place where there is a doubt, and
that is at El Dar, the ancient Thapsacus, where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
we understand at one season, when the waters are
at the lowest point, a camel can hardly go over;
but still, perhaps, further information may be
desirable. The Pasha has entered very heartily
into this plan, and offered either to clear out an
old canal, or to cut a new one between this river
and the Euphrates. The mouth of the Euphrates
is one extended marsh, which forms the best rice-grounds
of the country. The distance between
the two rivers at this place is about thirty miles.
Mr. James Taylor thinks that travellers may
reach England from this in twenty-three days,
and Bombay in twelve: should this ever take
place, steam boats will be passing twice a month
up and down this river with passengers from India
and England; the effects of such a change, both
moral, spiritual, and political, none can tell, but
that they must be great every one may see.</p>

<p>I have been this morning talking with my
Moolah about the two rivers, as to their capability
of steam navigation. He decidedly gives the
preference to the Euphrates, and says, that the
average depth is the height of two men, or ten feet&mdash;even
till considerably above Beer; but that the
Tigris, above Mousul, is very
shallow.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>


<p>This possibility thus set before us of seeing
those we love, and many of the Lord&#8217;s dear servants
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
here, is most comforting and encouraging:
this place would become a frontier post of Christian
labour, from which we might daily hope to
send forth labourers to China, India, and elsewhere,
and the work of publishing the testimony
of Jesus be accomplished before the Lord come.
However, we are in the Lord&#8217;s hands, and he
will bring to pass what concerns his own honour,
and we will wait and see: a much greater opening
has taken place since we came here than we could
have hoped for, and much more will yet open
upon us than we can now foresee. Things cannot
remain as they are, whether they continue to
advance as they are now doing, or whether bigotry
be allowed to make a last vain effort to regain her
ancient position; still some decided change must
be the final result of the present state of things.</p>

<p>From the Bible Society at Bombay, I have received
accounts of their having sent me two
English Bibles, fifty Testaments, twenty Arabic
Bibles, fifty Syriac Gospels, fifty Syriac Testaments,
fifty Armenian Bibles, one hundred Persian
Psalters, seventy-five Persian Genesis, and
six Hebrew Testaments. In this are omitted those
which are most important to us, the Chaldean,
the Persian, and the Arabic Testament; but perhaps
when they receive a supply from the Parent
Society, they will then forward these likewise.</p>

<p>I have also received a letter from Severndroog,
from the first tutor of my little boys, Mr. N., a
true and dear person in the Lord, and he mentions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
that they had, since he last wrote, admitted
to their church, four Hindoos and two Roman
Catholics, and that one Hindoo still remains, whom
they hope soon to admit.</p>

<p>The following is the estimate of the time which
the voyages, by the Red Sea, and by these rivers
to India, would respectively occupy:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/029.png" width="500" height="245" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
</p><p>I have recently had some conversation with Mr.
J. Taylor, who is waiting only to see the Pasha
to make final arrangements.</p>

<p>Another very important feature of the above
plan for steam communication with India is, that
those societies who have missionaries there, may
send out their secretaries to encourage and counsel
them, by which means they will be able not only
to enter more fully into the feelings and circumstances
of those they send, but will be able to
make their own reports, which will be more agreeable
to those engaged in the work&mdash;to tell about
which must always be a difficult undertaking.</p>

<p>I found yesterday that one of the gentlemen
who came hither lately from India, was a Mr.
Hull, the son of Mrs. Hull, of Marpool, near
Exmouth, who, however, is not going across the
desert, but round by Mosul and Merdin, to
Stamboul. He hopes to be home in September.</p>

<p>Mr. Pfander learnt from some Armenians
yesterday, that they were much pleased with the
children learning the Scriptures in the vulgar
dialect; that they were so far able to understand
the ancient language still read in their churches,
and they expressed a wish that they might have a
complete translation in the vulgar tongue. Those
Bibles we now have from the Bible Society, are in
the dialect of Constantinople, which is by no
means generally or well understood here, where the
Erivan dialect prevails, which they use in the
Karabagh, in the north of Persia, and in all these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
countries. The missionaries at Shushee are going
on with the New Testament: Mr. Dittrich has
finished the translation of the four Gospels, and
we hope it will be printed for the Bible Society
this year, for we greatly need Armenian books in
the vulgar dialect, by which we may, step by step,
supersede the old altogether. We also greatly
want Arabic school-books; but these we shall hope
to get from Malta, through the labours of Mr.
Jowett.</p>

<p>We find the general feeling here, not only among
Christians, but even among the Mohammedans, is
a wish that the English power might prevail here,
for although the Pasha does not directly tax them
high, yet from a bunch of grapes to a barrel of
gunpowder, he has the skimming of the cream,
and leaves the milk to his subjects to do with as
they can. Once a month at least the money is
changed. When the Pasha has a great deal of a
certain base money that he issues, he fixes the
price higher by certain degrees, on pain of
mutilation, and when he has paid it all away,
or has any great sums to receive, he lowers the
value by as many degrees as he has raised it
before. And hearing, as they universally do now,
of our government in India, that it is mild and
equitable, most of them would gladly exchange
their present condition, and be subject to the
British government. This conduct on the part of
the Pasha, begets an universal system of smuggling
and fraud among all classes, so that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
state of these people is indeed very, very bad. I
never felt more powerfully than now, the joy of having
nothing to do with these things; so that let
men govern as they will, I feel my path is to live in
subjection to the powers that be, and to exhort
others to the same, even though it be such
oppressive despotism as this. We have to shew
them by this, that our kingdom is not of this
world, and that these are not things about which
we contend. But our life being hid where no
storms can assail, &ldquo;with Christ in God&rdquo;&mdash;and our
wealth being where no moth or rust doth corrupt,
we leave those who are of this world to manage
its concerns as they list, and we submit to them
in every thing as far as a good conscience will
admit.</p>

<p><em>July 12.</em>&mdash;We have heard of two Jews, who
have bought two Hebrew New Testaments, and
a very respectable Jewish banker has been here
to see Mr. Pfander, with the German Jew,
whom I have mentioned before, and who is still
desirous of leaving the broad road, without heart
to trust in him who is in the heavenly path, the
way, the truth, and the life. He is now here,
endeavouring to obtain a livelihood by teaching a
few boys Hebrew, and comes to read the book
of Job in German with Mr. Pfander, without any
of their explanations, one of which, as it regards
Job, is as follows. They say that every individual
of the human race actually existed in Adam,
some in his nails, some in his toes, some in his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
eyes, mouth, &amp;c. &amp;c., and they think, in proportion
to the proximity of the position of any person
to the parts concerned in eating and digesting
the forbidden fruit, will be their degree of guilt
and measure of punishment here; so they consider
that Job had his place near the mouth. Such
are the follies which now occupy the minds of
this interesting people, instead of the Lord
of life and glory.</p>

<p>Colonization appears to have entered into the
contemplation of those engaged in steam-navigation,
and the planting of indigo and sugar. To
this end, the Pasha has granted them thirty miles
of land on the banks of the river. Just before
Mr. Taylor was to set off to go through the
desert, news came that the Arab tribes on the
road were at war among themselves, and that
it would therefore not be safe for him to go that
way, so he changed his route, and went on the
13th, by the way of Mousul and Merdin, nearly
double the distance, and at the same time, Mr.
Bywater and Mr. Elliot set off to Beer, from
whence they intend going down the Euphrates
and examining that river as far down as Babylon.</p>

<p>The old Jew, who came with the German,
heartily entered into some conversation about the
coming of Christ. A school of Jewish children
might, I think, easily be obtained here, if you
would teach them English and the Old Testament
only.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Our Moolah has mentioned, that he has been
reading the New Testament with another Moolah,
who wishes to have a copy of Sabat&#8217;s translation,
thinking that that might stimulate them to answer
it; but that the Propaganda edition is so vulgar,
it offends them, for like the Greeks they seek
after wisdom. Still, if they read, the testimony
of God is delivered, and the plucking a few
brands from the general conflagration, is the great
work till the Lord come. They have a most
proud and obstinate hatred against the name of
Jesus, before whom all must bow.</p>

<p>We have been interested by some inquiries
made by our schoolmaster and his father, relative
to our morning and evening prayers; he wanted
to know what they were, and Mr. Pfander had
the greatest difficulty in making him understand,
that we prayed from a sense of our present wants.
They said, they had heard from their books, that
in the time of the apostles men were without form
of prayer, and were enabled to pray from their
hearts; but that it was not so now. They also
asked some questions about the Lord&#8217;s Supper,
whether we used wine mixed with water or unmixed;
bread leavened or unleavened. They
seem anxious to know more, and may the Lord
give an open door to them!</p>

<p>We cannot help feeling, that the difficulties
among the Mohammedans, and apostate Christian
churches are great beyond any thing that can be
imagined previous to experience. The difficulties
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
of absolute falsehood are as nothing to those of
perverted truth, as we see in the confounding
infant baptism with the renewing of the Holy
Ghost. In every thing it is the same, prayer,
praise, love, all is perverted, and yet the
name retained. The communications we received
from Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;l and
others,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
about the state of Christianity in these countries, is
but too true, and what he states about the monks
at Itch-Meeazin may be doubtless true; at
least I suppose it is the seat of the Armenian
Patriarch he means, for I know of no other Armenian
church in these parts, where this service
is kept up of reading the whole Book of Psalms
every day. The office of a missionary in these
countries is, to <em>live</em> the Gospel before them in
the power of the Holy Ghost, and to drop like
the dew, line upon line, and precept upon precept,
here a little and there a little, till God give the
increase of his labours; but it must be by patient
continuance in well doing against every discouraging
circumstance, from the remembrance of
what we ourselves once were.</p>

<p>We have this day heard, that the cholera or
the plague is at Tabreez, and that they are dying
4 or 5,000 a day; but this, I have no doubt, is a
gross exaggeration. May the Lord watch over
the seed that seems sowing there, and make the
judgments that are in the earth warnings to men
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
to return to God. We also have the cholera here;
but I trust not severely.</p>

<p>The last Tartar who took our letters with the
head of the ex-Khiahya was plundered, so that
our letters were lost which we sent by him.</p>

<p>We have been to-day in hopes of obtaining
another Moolah, for teaching the children in
the school to read and write Arabic. For two
months we have been trying, without success, to
obtain one, so great is their prejudice against
teaching Christians at all, but especially
themselves to read the New Testament; but as our
Lord does every thing for us, we doubt not he
will do this also if it be best.</p>

<p>I am much led to think on those of my dear
missionary brethren, who look for the kingdom
of Christ to come in by a gradual extension of
the exertions now making. This view seems to
me very discouraging; for surely after labouring
for years, and so little having been done, we
may all naturally be led to doubt if we are in
our places; but to those who feel their place to
be to preach Jesus, and publish the Testament
in his blood, whether men will hear or whether
they will forbear, they have nothing to discourage
them, knowing they are a sweet savour of Christ.
I daily feel more and more, that till the Lord
come our service will be chiefly to gather out the
few grapes that belong to the Lord&#8217;s vine, and
publish his testimony in all nations; there may
be here and there a fruitful field on some pleasant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
hill, but as a whole, the cry will be, &ldquo;Who hath
believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the
Lord revealed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is the constant practice here among the
Jews, when they hear our blessed Lord&#8217;s name
mentioned, or mention it themselves, to curse
him; so awful is their present state of opposition,
Mohammedans will not hear, and Christians
do not care for any of those things&mdash;such
is the present state here; but if the Lord prosper
our labour, we shall see what the end will be,
when the Almighty word of God becomes understood.
The poor German Jew still holds on;
he has too much honesty to live by writing
lying amulets, and too little faith to cast himself
on the Lord; but his constant cry is, What shall
I do to live? The insight he gives us into the
state of the Jews here is most awful, but
notwithstanding, there appears to me a most abundant
field of labour among the 10,000 who are
here. Yesterday he called me suddenly while
at breakfast, to see a poor young Jewess who
had been married but two months, and had fallen
over the bridge with her little brother in her
arms. The scene was awfully interesting. Not
less perhaps than 300 Jews, with their wives,
were in the house, but tumultuous as the waves
of the sea, without hope and without God in the
world. There was no hope of recovering her.
She had been in the water an hour and a half,
and had there been life, they were acting so as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
to extinguish every spark. She was lying in a
close room crowded to suffocation, with the
windows shut; and they were burning under her
nose charcoal and wool.</p>

<p>The Armenian boys, who are learning English,
go on with great zeal, and may in the course of
time become very interesting.</p>

<p>We have at length received information, that
all our things are arrived at Bussorah, and among
the rest, the lithographic press, which we hope
to find most useful to us in our present position;
every thing happens rightly and well; they have
been delayed for some time in coming up the
river, in consequence of a quarrel between the
Pasha and the Arab tribe, the Beni-Laam, in
consequence of the plunder of Dr. Beaky&#8217;s boat,
but we expect it will be settled, as the Pasha
has acceded to the terms the Sheikh offered, and
has sent him down a dress of honour.</p>

<p>I am sometimes led, in contemplating the gentlemanly
and imposing aspect which our present
missionary institutions bear, and contrasting them
with the early days of the church, when apostolic
fishermen and tent-makers published the testimony,
to think that much will not be done till
we go back again to primitive principles, and
let the nameless poor, and their unrecorded and
unsung labours be those on which our hopes,
under God, are fixed.</p>

<p>We have just heard an interesting case. The
gardener of the Pasha is a Greek, who was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
lately sent to him at his request from Constantinople,
and yesterday (August 6), he became a
Mohammedan. He had two daughters of thirteen
and fourteen, whom he also wished to become
Mohammedans; but they would not consent, and
ran away to the factory, where they might have
remained under English protection; but they
would not stay, unless their brother, and his
wife, and their servants could remain with them;
so they left, as Major T&mdash;&mdash; had not room for
them all, having already the family of one of the
servants of the Pasha, who is imprisoned for some
delinquency in connection with the revenue accruing
to the Pasha from the bazaar.</p>

<p>There has been with Mr. Pfander to-day one of
the writers of the Pasha, and he read some parts
of the Turkish New Testament, which he very
well understood, and expressed much pleasure in
the reading of; but when, on his being about to
leave, Mr. P. asked him to accept of a Turkish
Testament, he very politely declined it.</p>

<p>There is another person come from Merdin,
with the view of settling the affair between the
Syrians and the Roman Catholics at Merdin.
He is a weaver of Diarbekr; and from him Mr.
Pfander learns, that in the last census taken
by the Pasha, the Syrians were 700 families, and
the Armenians 6,700: this certainly opens a
most interesting field for Christian inquiry: he
also said, that the Syrians in the mountains were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
perfectly independent of the Mohammedans, and
among themselves are divided into little clans
under their respective Bishops. He also stated,
that reading and writing were much more cultivated
among the independent Syrians than those
in the plains.</p>

<p>He also said there would be no difficulty whatever
in going among the Yezidees with a Syrian
guide. The language which the independent
Syrians speak is Syriac, which is near the ancient
Syriac, and that they understand fully the
Syrian Scriptures when read in their churches.
We hope, therefore, should the Lord spare our
lives, to have an opportunity of circulating some
of the many copies of the Scriptures in Syriac,
which Mr. Pfander has brought from Shushee,
and some that I expect will come from Bombay
for me.</p>

<p>The Gerba tribe of Arabs are come almost
close to Bagdad, to check whom the Pasha
intends sending out the troops that have been
under the discipline of the English.</p>

<p>We have also heard from the Syrian, that from
Mousul to Mardin the road by the mountains of
Sinjar is safer than by the plains. Among the Yezidees
and Syrians, no Mohammedan lives. It is
impossible to consider such an immense Christian
population as that in Diarbekr, without feeling
a wish to pour in upon it the fountains of living
waters, which we are so abundantly blessed with.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Oh, that some one would come out, and settle
down in such a place as Diarbekr&mdash;what an abundant
field of labour!</p>

<p><em>August 14.</em>&mdash;A young Jew was here to-day,
and bought three Arabic Bibles of Mr. Pfander,
at 25 piastres of this place each, <em>i.e.</em> about 5s.
sterling. This is almost the beginning. Many
might perhaps have been given away; but as we
find that those of Mr. Wolff were generally
burnt, we wish them to buy them, at least, at
such a price that they would not burn them.
He took away a Hebrew New Testament, but
returned it again. I should feel deeply interested
in some one coming to take charge of a Jewish
school, in which the Old Testament, Hebrew, and
Arabic, might be the basis of instruction. I make
no doubt, that at once a most interesting school
might be established here on a very large scale,
for they have but one school of about 150 poor
boys at their synagogue, or rather synagogues,
for they have six, but all in one place, and forming
one building; they have also three rabbies,
and besides the boys which are taught at the
above school, many others are educated at home
by teachers. Now, nothing can be more distinct
than their wish for a school, and their promise
of supporting it on the basis of the Old Testament
being taught as a school-book, which certainly,
as a primary step, is a most important one
to cause them, by the Lord&#8217;s blessing, to see that
the book which they now disfigure by monstrous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
interpretations, has yet in itself, by the illumination
of God&#8217;s Spirit, a clear, simple, and, in all
essential points, an intelligible meaning, without
the aid of man&#8217;s exposition. But should they
finally turn round and oppose the school, which
as soon as the power of it is felt, they most
assuredly would do, still some might remain, and
if none should, there is still a most abundant field
of labour in circulating the Scriptures, and in
conversation among them in this city, and throughout
Mesopotamia, where they abound in almost every town.</p>

<p>We have heard from a Jew, that Sakies, the
Armenian Agent of the East India Company, had
given the Jews directions to treat Mr. Wolff
when here with attention, and to invite him to
their houses. The Jews here are closely connected
with the English, at least many of them,
who are under English protection.</p>

This is the time when the dates ripen, and the most
oppressive in the year; but by the Lord&#8217;s great
mercy, we are all in health and strength, though
sometimes we feel a little disposed to think it
is so hot, that we may be excused from doing
any thing; but my English scholars keep me
employed six hours a day, which prevents me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
from thinking much about the heat, though not
from feeling it. I can truly say, it is far more
tolerable than I expected, and yet there are few
places on the face of the earth hotter. The
temperature of India is not near so high; and I
question, if there is any place, that for the year
through would average so high.</p>

<p><em>August 17.</em>&mdash;The Jew has been here, and
bought another Arabic Bible. I showed him
one of the Hebrew Psalters of the Jews&#8217; Society.
He greatly desired to have it; but I could
not spare that; but promised him that when mine
came up from Bussorah, I would let him know.</p>

<p>We have this day a new Moolah, the best we
could get, but not altogether such as we could
have desired.</p>

<p>The Jews here cannot believe that Christians
know any thing of Hebrew, and are therefore
surprised to see Hebrew books with us. Oh,
should the Lord allow us to be of any use to this
holy people, terrible from their beginning hitherto
alike in the favour and indignation of Jehovah,
we should esteem it a very great blessing; yet
surely they ought to have here one missionary,
whose whole soul might be drawn out towards
this especial work.</p>

<p>From some communications with a native of
Merdin, we find that the custom of avenging
murder and requiring blood for blood, exists
among the independent Chaldeans and Syrians,
and keeps them in continual warfare, where one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
happens to be killed by the inhabitants of another
village. The inhabitants of the village of the
person killed, feel it a necessary point of honour
to revenge it.</p>

<p>He also mentioned, that the Yezidees were no
longer so numerous as formerly, but were greatly
diminished by the plague, which happened a few
years ago, by which Diarbekr lost 10,000 of its
inhabitants.</p>

<p>We had a visit from an Armenian, who was
formerly treasurer to Sir Gore Ouseley; while
speaking about Christianity, he said, it was no
use to speak to the Armenians about it, for they
all say, &ldquo;How can we know any thing about
such matters, and that, except as a sect, they are
too ignorant to know or care about Christianity.&rdquo;
They are indeed full of the pride of heart that
appertains to sectarians, and obstinately resist the
Scriptures being translated into the modern languages,
because, say they, the ancient language
was spoken in Paradise, and will be the language
of heaven, and that, therefore, translating the
sacred book into that which is modern, is a
desecration. How wonderfully does Satan blind men,
and how by one contrivance or another does he
endeavour to keep God&#8217;s word from them, as a
real intelligible book, which the Spirit of God
makes plain, even to the most unlettered; but
the more we discover him endeavouring to pervert
God&#8217;s word from becoming intelligible, the more
we should strive to let every soul have the testimony
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
of God concerning his life in Christ, in a
language he understands. In this point of view
I look to the schools with comfort.</p>

<p><em>August 19.</em>&mdash;Things here seem most unsettled,
and require us to live in very simple faith as to
what a day may bring forth. It is stated, that
between 20 and 30,000 Arabs are close to the
gates of the city. The Pasha has an army about
24 miles from hence; but unable to move, except
all together, and there is another regiment under
an English officer about 12 miles distant. The
deposition of this Pasha seems to be the principal
object of these Arabs, in which it is not impossible
that they may be fully supported by the
Porte. What will be the result of all this we
are not careful to know, for we are not to fear
their face, nor to be afraid, but the Lord will be
to us a hiding place from the storm, when the
blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against a
wall.</p>

<p>A caravan has just come across the desert
from Aleppo, with a guard of 500 men, consisting
of 300 camels. Letters brought by a Tartar
from Constantinople have all been detained by
the Pasha, except a few on mercantile concerns
which have been delivered. So many packets
sent by Constantinople have been in one way
or another detained, that I have no other hope
of letters than what my most gracious Lord&#8217;s
approved love gives me; all which he really desires
me to have I shall receive, and more I
would desire not to wish for.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
We have just heard, that Major T&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s
brother, and the gentlemen who left Mousul
were pursued by 500 Arabs; but all escaped
except a horse of the
Capidji,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
an officer of the
Sultan&#8217;s, which was laden with money, collected
by his master for the government at Constantinople;
he could not go fast enough, so he fell
into the hands of the Arabs.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic bishop has received accounts
that Algiers is taken by the French, and
also some forts in its neighbourhood. Aleppo is
quiet, though the Arabs are in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Our new Moolah has expressed his surprise at
the contents of the New Testament, and wonders
how Mohammedans can speak against it as they
do. He intends coming to our Armenian schoolmaster
on Sundays to read it with him; may the
Lord most graciously send down his Spirit upon
them, that the one who undertakes to teach what
he does not know, may, by discovering his ignorance,
be led to the fountain of all wisdom; and
may the other learn to love him whose holy, heavenly,
and divine name he has blasphemed.</p>

<p>The cholera is much about, but the Lord preserves
us all safe.</p>

<p>The Pasha has made up his differences with the
Arab tribe, and all the troops have returned, except
those under Mr. Littlejohn, which still remain
out for fear of an attack before all the harvest is
thrashed and brought in.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
There are symptoms of great fear on the part
of the Pasha, that a struggle is actually going on
among those around him for superseding him in
his Pashalic, in which they have apparently much
probability of success, as the Porte has been greatly
injured by his unwillingness to meet her necessities
and afford her pecuniary help. Our security,
however, is in this, that amidst all, the Lord
knoweth them that are his, and will defend them
amidst all turmoils and in the most troublous
times&mdash;in this we find peace and quietness.</p>

<p>The poor men who came to endeavour to obtain
from the Pasha here the re-institution of the Syrian
patriarch in those churches in Merdin, from which
he had been ejected by the Roman Catholic
bishop, are now returning without success, but
carrying back with them two boxes of Arabic and
Syrian New Testaments to the Patriarch. May
the Lord water them by his most Holy Spirit, so
that they may become the ground of living churches,
instead of those of stone which they have lost.</p>

<p>I have been much surprised to learn that all the
Arab tribes on these rivers, except the Montefeiks,
are Sheahs or followers of Ali, whom I had formerly
thought followers of Omar.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned, that on leaving Mousul,
Mr. Taylor&#8217;s party were attacked and obliged
to return to
Telaafer,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
a village between Mousul
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and Merdin, whence, after having waited for a
stronger escort, they proceeded towards Merdin,
when the event related in the following
letter took place; but the supposed death of the
three gentlemen was unfounded. They were only
made prisoners and carried to the mountains of
Sinjar, among the Yezidees. These people are
declared enemies of the Mohammedans, whom
they hate; but, on the whole, except when their
cupidity is excited, they are not unfriendly towards
Christians. They seem, with the Sabeans
and some others, such as the Druzes, to be descendants
of the believers in the two principles who
have blown their pestiferous breath at different
times into every system of religion that has prevailed
in these countries, corrupting all. However,
these Yezidees, be they originally what they may,
have now these three gentlemen in custody, and
require 7,500 piastres of this place&mdash;about &pound;75,
for their liberation, and Major T. has sent a person
from hence to treat about it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;My dear Sir,</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, I can assure you, with a sincere
and melancholy regret at the dreadful, I may say
horrible and awful event that I have so lately
witnessed, that I sit down now to address a few
lines to you. I feel quite unable to give you an
entire relation of our misfortunes, and shall content
myself with saying, that out of seven as happy
people as could well exist on our departure from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Mousul, three only have returned. To one so well
able to look for consolation, where, I may say, in
such an event consolation is alone to be found,
fortitude and patience in suffering might well be
found. I myself have not attained this, and I
may say this event has plunged me in the deepest
melancholy. For a relation of facts, I must refer
you to Captain Cockrell&#8217;s letter to Major Taylor:
we were attacked and compelled to fly, and in the
confusion, Mr. Taylor, his servant, Mr. Bywater,
and our companion, Mr. Aspinal, were murdered.
We, that is Captain Cockrell, Mr. Elliot, and
myself escaped, though I was, I believe, especially
fired at, as on descending the hill four or
five whistled close past me. That we were betrayed,
and moreover, our companions assassinated
by our own party, no doubt exists in my mind.
All that were killed out of 500 people that were
with us were these four. They again, out of all,
happened to be the only ones among us who carried
money. We have done every thing in our power
to recover their bodies but without effect: on our
return to Telaafer, after having been twenty-six
hours on horseback in the desert, we wrote a note,
in the hope that they might be prisoners at Sinjar,
and offered 4,000 piastres for them if they were
brought in safe. The Kapidgi Bashi left for
Merdin before we could hear of our messenger;
he returned after three days, and said he had seen
their clothes and pistols, and that they were all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
murdered. Mr. Taylor he mentioned as having
been run through the body with a spear. This
was one out of many reports of a similar nature,
and we were fain to give them up for dead. (They
could not possibly have been alive had they escaped,
as there was no water within twenty-four
hours.) All our things were pillaged. I lost all
my papers, including your letters, and all that
was left were a few pairs of white trowsers. This
was most assuredly done by our own party; even
our own baggage man, before my eyes, almost laid
hold of my turban and pistol, which I had laid upon
the ground, and on my laying hold on him, actually
drew his dagger. I never witnessed such
villany in my life. All our guards were laughing,
as if nothing had occurred; and, although I may
be wrong, yet I do venture it as my opinion,
that there were no thieves at all, but that it was
treachery altogether. You will be surprised to
hear that Captain Cockrell and myself start to-morrow
on the same road as before. I trust in
God alone for protection, as we have no guards
at all. If I ever reach Exeter I shall not fail to
call on Miss Groves; but after what has happened
who can say, &ldquo;He shall do this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We take no baggage of any description, being
fully aware of the danger and impracticability of
so doing; so that if we are again attacked, we
shall be able to gallop for our lives. Now, adieu,
my dear Sir. I will write from Constantinople if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
I reach it; in the mean time excuse this hurried
scrawl, and believe me, ever</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 20em;">&ldquo;Yours very sincerely,</span><br />
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 25em;">&ldquo;W. Hull.</span>&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;<em>Mr. A. N. Groves.</em>&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>In consequence of the receipt of this intelligence,
Major T. sent off Aga Menas to Mousul,
to treat about the liberation of the captives, and
we are anxiously waiting the result.</p>

<p>My dear brother Pfander and myself having come
to the conclusion, that with so large a school, and so
many objects of one kind and the other as there
are here requiring attention, it would be impossible
for me to leave this and go with him into
the mountains; this led to the further determination
on his part to return to Shushee next
year, having first spent a few months at Ispahan, to
complete his knowledge of Persian; and I of course
was prepared to be left quite alone, but still my
heart was fully sustained with the confident hope
that the Lord would not only do what was right,
but exceedingly abundant above all I could ask.
On all sides nothing but silence prevailed:&mdash;three
packets of letters had been lost between Constantinople
and this, and one between Tabreez and this,
and all the letters from India had been detained,
by the Arabs on the river being at war with the
Pasha for four or five months. Therefore I knew
nothing of the movements of any of my dear
friends, and all was left to conjecture; sometimes,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
when faith was in full exercise, I felt assured that
the Lord was doing all well; at others, I hardly
knew what to think. I had written to my very
dear friends in Petersburgh, Dr. W. and Miss K.
to come if possible and as soon as possible; but
their having left Petersburgh doubtless prevented
their receiving my letter. From my dear friends
in England I heard little; from Ireland not a
word. Things were in this state, when suddenly
there came in three Tartars bringing us three packets,
so full of Christian love, sympathy, and such
good tidings, that it almost overcame our hearts,
weak from long abstinence from similar entertainment,
and even on this day, the third from their
arrival, they fill my heart till it runs over. To
hear and see that those one most loves, are indeed
joying and rejoicing in their holy, most holy
relation to God in Christ,&mdash;the relationship of sons
and daughters, to see them anxious to walk blameless
in all the ordinances their Lord has left them,
while they glory in being free from the law of
condemnation, and desire to know no freedom
from the law of loving obedience: moreover, to
see them becoming more and more sensible to the
great truth that inestimable as knowledge is, it is
what devils may share, but that the love of Jesus,
and a tenderness of conscience as to his will, is
infinitely higher than that, and that therefore his
high command to the members of his church to
love one another as he loves them, can never
be slighted by them:&mdash;oh, to see this it does
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
indeed rejoice my heart, and I pray among us
all that it may abound more and more, particularly
among us who have been so graciously
and so kindly led into all the holy freedom of the
Gospel. Let us see we use it not as a cloak of
maliciousness, but as the servants of Christ, loving
and serving one another, not returning evil for
evil, or reviling for reviling, but contrariwise
blessing. The path God&#8217;s children have to take
when they are determined in the name of the
Lord not to give the name of God&#8217;s truth to any
thing merely human, knowing that it is a vain
thing to teach for doctrines the commandments of
men, is so naturally offensive, that our zeal for
the truth should lead us to pray for such especial
graces of the Spirit as may prevent any unloveliness
in our walk, preventing the Lord&#8217;s dear children
from coming, and seeing, and drinking of that
well-spring in Christ by which we have been so
refreshed and invigorated. Whilst we profess, my
very dear friends, absolute freedom from man&#8217;s
control in the things relating to God, we only
acknowledge in a tenfold degree the absoluteness
of our subjection to the whole mind and will of
Christ in all things. As he is our <em>life</em> hid with
him in God, so let him be our <em>way</em> and our <em>truth</em>,
both in doctrine and conversation. How many,
from neglect of this lovely union, have almost
forgotten to care about adorning the doctrine of God
their Saviour in all things. Let us, my dear brethren
and sisters, pray that we may be united in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
all the will of Christ. This is a basis not for time
only but for eternity, and for that glorious day
especially, when the Lord shall come to be glorified
in all his saints, and admired in all them that
believe. But not only did my packets bring me joyful
tidings of the Lord&#8217;s doings among those whom
I especially know and love, but they also brought
me intelligence that he had prepared for me help
from among those who had been known and
approved, and whom I especially loved. How I
felt reproved for every doubt; and indeed the
Lord so fully has let his goodness pass before
me, that I am overwhelmed, and feel I can only
lay my hand upon my mouth, and whilst overwhelmed
with my own vileness and unworthiness
of the least of all my most gracious Lord&#8217;s
loving kindnesses to me, yet glory in that dispensation
of grace which ministers to us, not according
to our deserts, but the unbought, unbounded
love of God. My letters tell me that my very
dear brethren and friends, Mr. P., Mr. C., his
sister, and mother, and little babe, and Mr. N.,
are coming to join us, with possibly a fourth. Now
this does seem altogether wonderful, and whilst
not at all more than I ought to have expected,
yet more than I had faith to expect. Yet while
I have nothing to say for myself, I desire to say
all for God: it is like him, all whose ways are
wonderful, and, towards his church, full of mercy,
goodness, and truth. Oh, how happy shall we
be to await the Lord&#8217;s coming on the banks of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
these rivers, which have been the scene of all the
sacred history of the old church of God, and destined
still, I believe, to be the scene of doings of
yet future and deeper interest at the coming of
the Lord; and whilst I should not hesitate to go
to the furthest corner of the habitable earth, were
my dear Lord to send me, yet I feel much pleasure
in having my post appointed here, though
the most unsettled and insecure country beneath
the sun perhaps. In every direction, without
are lawless robbers, and within unprincipled
extortioners; but it is in the midst of these,
that the Almighty arm of our Father delights to
display his preserving mercy, and while the
flesh would shrink, the spirit desires to wing
its way to the very foremost ranks of danger
in the battles of the Lord. Oh that we may more
and more press on this sluggish, timid, earthly
constitution, that is always wanting its native
ease among the delights of an earthly happiness.
Oh, may my very loving, zealous brethren, stir up
my timid, languid spirit to the mild yet life-renouncing
love of my dear Lord, which, whilst it
was silent, was as strong, yea, stronger than death.</p>

<p>My dear friend and brother P&mdash;&mdash; and his
wife have been baptized too; to see this conformity
to Christ&#8217;s mind, is very delightful; and
how wonderful, too;&mdash;so strong a current of prejudice
is there against this simple, intelligible,
and blessed ordinance. I learn also, that he and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
my dear friend the
A&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
are preaching the
everlasting Gospel themselves, and with some
others of those we love, employing others to
preach it. This also is good news.</p>

<p><em>September 10.</em>&mdash;No accounts have been received
from Sinjar regarding our travellers. I fear this is
ominous, for if ransom is what the Yezidees want,
would they not have contrived to forward some
notice to Bagdad? however, a few days will most
likely disclose the truth, as on the 8th Meenas
reached Mousul.</p>

<p>We have just heard that the Nabob of
Lucknow&#8217;s brother, on his return from a pilgrimage
to Mished, was taken prisoner with the
whole caravan by the Turcomans. This amiable
Mohammedan came from India on a round of
pilgrimages. He has visited Mecca and Kerbala,
and was now returning again to this place on
his way home to Lucknow, after which he purposed
returning again, and going through Persia,
Russia, Germany, &amp;c. to England. He was
robbed once before between this and Aleppo.</p>

<p>The Pasha has just sent to the Factory to
say, that the cholera has extended its ravages
to Kerkook, and to ask for advice, and what is
to be done should it reach this place with its
epidemic violence. Mr. M&mdash;&mdash; is going therefore
to write directions, and Major T&mdash;&mdash; will
get them translated into Arabic, for the use of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the people here. Blessed be the Lord&#8217;s holy
name, our charter runs, that in the pestilence,
&ldquo;though ten thousand fall at thy right hand,
it shall not come nigh thee;&rdquo; on this, therefore,
we repose our hearts. The Pasha seems perplexed
to know, in the event of its reaching
Bagdad, where he shall go with his family for
safety. It is certainly an awful thing to look at
Tabreez, where they say, that 8,000 or 9,000
have died out of 60,000; and two years ago at
Bussorah, 1,500 out of 6,000, so that the houses
were left desolate, and the boats were floating
up and down the creek without owners, and
when persons died in a house, the rest went
away, and left the bodies there locked up. But
we have in our dwellings a light in these days
that they know nothing of, who know not our
God either in his power or his love, so that the
heart is enabled to cast all, even the dearest to it,
on the exceeding abundance of his mercy.</p>

<p><em>September 10.</em>&mdash;I fear the intelligence we have
just received of poor Mr. J. Taylor, Mr. Bywater,
and Mr. Aspinal, and the Maltese servant, leaves
us little room to hope but that they have all
been treacherously murdered. Our Moolah tells
us, he received a letter from a friend of his at
Merdin, stating, that they were murdered&mdash;not
by the Yezidees at all, but by the party of Arabs
sent by the Pasha of Mousul to protect them, in
conjunction with a party from Telaafer, an Arab
village, where they spent a night. It appears,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
that when the attack was made, Mr. Elliot,
Captain Cockrell, and Mr. Hull galloped off
after being stripped; but Mr. Taylor, Mr. Aspinal,
and Mr. Bywater got entangled among
these robbers, and Mr. A. shot one of the Arabs
with his pistol; and afterwards Mr. B. shot
another. It then became with these lawless
plunderers, no longer a matter of simple robbery,
but of revenge and death. They killed these
two young men, and then pulling Mr. Taylor
from his horse, killed him. I confess, when I
saw them mounting their horses, strongly covered
with offensive weapons of warfare, I felt very
little comfort about them, for, if they were
attacked, it would only be with an overwhelming
force, or they would be given up in treachery,
in both which cases almost all the danger arises
from resistance.  Those wretched plunderers
seek not life, but booty; this quietly yielded,
you may go; but if you use the sword, you perish
by the sword. If you carry money, or any thing
valuable, you are exposed to be stripped, and if
you go armed, to be killed. About three years
ago, the French interpreter was going the very
same route, and near Telaafer he was attacked,
and stripped; but they let him go free. The
fate of these gentlemen has greatly affected us
all. A delay must now take place in the steamboat
communication, for it is not probable that this
route can ever be so disregarded, but that some
effort, sooner or later, will be made.  Let our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
impatient hearts hush their murmurings; it is
the work of a loving Father, who declares to his
children, that all things shall work together for
their good; yea, the disappointment of present
hopes shall, by heavenly patience, yield the peaceable
fruits of righteousness to those who are exercised
thereby.</p>

<p><em>September 14.</em>&mdash;We have just heard, that an
order has been given out in one of the mosques,
that the Mohammedans shall receive no printed
books. Whether this watchfulness is the result
of Mr. Pfander having employed a man, a Jew,
to sell Bibles, Testaments, and Psalters, or
whether, at the suggestion from the R&mdash;&mdash; C&mdash;&mdash;
B&mdash;&mdash;, I know not. How near the principles
are of the beast and the false prophet&mdash;how easily
they harmonize and help each other!</p>

<p>We have lately heard some interesting details
of the numbers of the Jews in the places north-east
of Persia. A Jew who has travelled in these
countries states, that there are,</p>

<p>There are also in the villages about some Jews,
from 20 to 100 families. Their knowledge of the
Hebrew is very confined; very few understand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
it at all; they have also very little knowledge
of the Talmud. We hope from time to time to
collect more particulars to correct, confirm, or
cancel these, and all other accounts of a similar
nature, for in these countries it is not one account
that can stand, and when confronted by 50 more, it
can still be only considered as an approximation
to truth.</p>

<p><em>September 16.</em>&mdash;Our long expected packet by
Shushee and Tabreez has just arrived. The
messenger, on reaching Kourdistan, found it in
such a state of danger and confusion, that he was
afraid to proceed, but went back again, and
came by a longer but more quiet way. Another
cause of delay seems to have been their going to
India, and back again to Tabreez. The information
contained in this packet is most interesting.
From Petersburgh we heard from several
friends, all encouraging, comforting, and rejoicing
us. The Lord seems to give them courage still
to persevere; and dear sister&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;intends, after
recruiting a little in England, to return again to
her work there. I feel satisfied it is a most
interesting field, and that ere long in Russia
some tremendous changes will take place. The
poor are anxious for the word of God, and the
nobility despising the hierarchy, and, therefore,
that blind priestly domination under which it has
groaned, will finally fall to pieces; infidelity will
take openly its side, and the Lord&#8217;s saints theirs.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. K&mdash;&mdash; tells us, that some dear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
American brother, by name Lewis, has sent him
money to procure for his family a house in the
country during the few months of a Russian
summer. How loving and bountiful a Lord ours
is, supplying his most affectionate and waiting
servant with all he needs; it makes every little
bounty so sweet when it comes from a Father
through one of his vessels of mercy. Oh, who
would not live a life of faith in preference to
one of daily, hourly satiety&mdash;I mean as to earthly
things; how very many instances of happiness
should we have been deprived of, had we not
trusted to, and left it to his love to fill us with
good things as he pleased, and to spread our
table as he has done, year after year, and will do,
even here in this wilderness.</p>

<p>From Shushee we have also heard, that our
dear brother Z&mdash;&mdash; and an Armenian had been
travelling and selling Bibles and Testaments.
They went first to Teflis; from thence to Erzeroum,
Erivan, Ech-Miazin, and back again to Shushee.
What success he had in selling Bibles and Testaments
we do not know, but at Erzeroum, he was
accused by the Mohammedans before the Russian
authorities, but let go. He returned home in
safety under the hand of the Lord. There is also
in the letters of our brethren most pleasing accounts
of a young Armenian, the son-in-law of
the richest Armenian merchant in Baku, supposed
to be worth half a million. This young
man, at a visit of Z&mdash;&mdash; and P&mdash;&mdash;, was much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
interested by their conversation about the New
Testament, and they went away, leaving him an
interesting inquirer. He, however, still pursued
his way alone, and attained a perfect understanding
of the Armenian Testament, which at first
he was able to read but indifferently. He then
felt himself unable to proceed in mercantile transactions
as before; so that his father-in-law told
him, that much as he regretted separating from
him, if he became so pious, they must part.
Well, he said, he could not give up his convictions,
and he was sure his Lord would not allow
him to want; so he left his father-in-law, and
learnt the trade of a taylor. From the very first
he began to teach his wife, and she takes part
with him; and he is now selling Bibles and
Testaments, and circulating tracts among the
Russian soldiers. This is a sight indeed! for
centuries perhaps they have not seen one of their
own body rising up, and choosing to suffer
affliction with the people of God, rather than
enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; and the
sight is as strange to Mohammedans as to Christians.
May the Lord sustain, comfort, and bless
him out of his heavenly treasures.</p>

<p>From Tabreez our tidings are heavy, or rather
would be, but that the Lord of love directs and
orders all, and sees the end from the beginning,
yet they have also good tidings too. I have
already mentioned, that the cholera had been
raging at Tabreez; but we learn, that not only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
this, but the plague is there also, to a most frightful
extent. I will just copy here the account
our dear sister Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash; has given us; and
for whose safety we desire to bless the Lord;
she says,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Before this reaches you, you may have heard
of the sorrow and desolation that have befallen
this city within these last two months. Thousands
around us have been cut off by the cholera and
the plague. The former raged so furiously for
the first month, that 2 or 300 died daily. Symptoms
of the plague first were discovered in the
ark among the Russian soldiers, which manifested
itself by breaking out over the body in
large boils; the person attacked, feeling himself
overcome by stupor; many died before it was
thought what it was; precautions were taken,
and they were sent out to camp at some distance
from the town. The disorder has not raged
among them so much as it has in the town. I
cannot tell you how great the fear was that was
struck into the minds of the people. Many were
taken ill through fear, of which they died. Previous
to the city being quite deserted, men,
women, children, of all denominations, collected
themselves together in large bodies, crying and
beseeching God to turn away his judgments from
them: this they did bareheaded and without shoes,
humbling themselves, they said, because they
knew they were great sinners. The air resounded
with their cries day and night, particularly the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
latter, and often during the whole of it. Oh,
did they but know the truth as it is in Jesus.
At length all classes fled to the mountains, leaving
the town quite deserted. Alexander told me,
on his return one day from the city, that he
had not met a person. All the shops in the
bazaar were forsaken, so that from this you may
derive some idea of the terror that has possessed
this people.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash; also tells us, that the establishment
at Tabreez is going to be much reduced,
and that therefore Mr. N&mdash;&mdash; is ordered back
to India. This has tried them much, for they
were just expecting two American missionaries,
a Mr. Dwight and a Mr. Smith, with whom they
were hoping to have acted happily for their
common Lord. But the Lord&#8217;s ways are not
our ways, nor his thoughts our thoughts, so these
things happen otherwise than we expected.
However, wherever they go, may they be blessed,
and a blessing. They purpose coming here on
their way, which affords us much pleasure at
the prospect of seeing them again. However,
we are greatly rejoiced to think, that brethren
from America have designed Tabreez for their
station. Now between Shushee, Tabreez, and
this place we have a little frontier line. Oh,
may there be daily new ambassadors of mercy
publishing the testimony of Jesus in all the
world. Oh, that the end may quickly come.</p>

<p>Our Moolah is dreadfully depressed to-day,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
at the prospect of the cholera and plague coming
here, and he said to me, he thought the end of
the world must be near, because of these wars,
pestilences, and plagues.</p>

<p>We have also heard that we shall most likely
be obliged to leave this house after the year has
expired; for the Sheahs have been complaining
to the Seyd,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
the owner of it, for letting it to
the infidels for such a purpose. But we are not
careful about these things; it will be as the Lord
wills.</p>

<p>Nothing can show the stupid carelessness of
these people more, than that, although they are
frightened out of their reason almost at the
prospect of the plague and cholera, yet they
have actually allowed a whole caravan from
Tabreez to come into the city without quarantine,
or any kind of precaution.</p>

<p>Oh, how joyful the promises in the Revelations
are for &ldquo;those written in the Lamb&#8217;s book
of life,&rdquo; for &ldquo;those who have not the mark of
the beast on them,&rdquo; for those who are to be
sealed before the angels are allowed to hurt the
earth. Yea, he will for his great name&#8217;s sake
hide us in the secret of his pavilion, so that he
will put a song into our mouths; yea, he will
encompass us with songs of deliverance. We
feel that it now indeed especially becomes us
neither to fear their fear nor be afraid.</p>

<p><em>Sept.</em>&mdash;The weather is now become decidedly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
cooler. A fortnight since the average height of the
thermometer in the shade, during the warmest
part of the day, was 117; it is now lowered to 110.
During the hottest time of the year, which is now
just over, the quicksilver was rarely lower than 110,
or higher than 118 in the shade, except in the
morning, when the general range was from 87
to 93.</p>

<p>The Seyd who has let us his house, and who
we had heard intended to turn us out after the
year was expired, has got into trouble with the
Pasha, about some ground he rented, and for
which he was to pay the Pasha a certain quantity
of corn; but he says, what from the locusts, and
the rain not coming at the usual time, and when
it did come, coming in such unusual quantities, he
lost his crop. He has now come begging us to take
his case to Major T., to beg him to endeavour
to settle it with the Musruff. Thus the Lord
has brought him into difficulties, that if he were
disposed to turn us out he would not be able this
year. But he denies altogether having said any
thing about turning us out, and it is not improbable
that it is as he says; his family which is a
large one, and once were opulent, feel it a great
disgrace to let out the house of one of the descendants
of the prophet to a Christian, and more
especially as one of the rooms is over the street
under which the Mohammedans have to walk,
and this most especially offends them; but that
we might not give them any unnecessary offence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
we have never occupied the room, though the most
airy one we have.</p>

<p>A Jew of Yezd has been with us, and told us
that there are 300 families of Jews in that city,
and the same number at Ispahan.</p>

<p><em>Sept. 24.</em>&mdash;A caravan has just arrived from
Constantinople, by way of Aleppo. We have
also heard that one caravan from Damascus has
been plundered, and another from Kerkook: and
a messenger likewise who came from Captain
Campbell, from Tabreez, was also stopped, but
having nothing besides letters, was suffered to
pass. I note these events down merely that they
may afford a little criterion of the unsettled state
of the whole of the interior of this immense continent.
In fact, the Lord is, amidst these commotions,
preparing a way for his testimony to spread.</p>

<p>The cholera, by the Lord&#8217;s blessing, is decreasing,
but it is reported that at Kerkook the mortality
went as high as 100 a day; it has now,
however, ceased.</p>

<p><em>Sept. 27.</em>&mdash;The intelligence has been confirmed
of the death of Mr. Taylor, Mr. Aspinal, and Mr.
Bywater, as well as of a Maltese servant, and that
the principal perpetrators were the Sheikh of Telaafer,
in conjunction with a Sheikh of the Yezidees,
who were with the caravan at the time.</p>

<p>The Nawaub mentioned before, has been delivered
by the Prince of Teheran sending an
army into Khorassan, and with him all the caravan.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
<em>Sept. 29.</em>&mdash;Meenas has just been here, and the
only particulars he has given of the unfortunate
travellers, in addition to that which we knew before
is, that Mr. Aspinal made his escape with
the others, but hearing a cry from Mr. Taylor
and Mr. Bywater, he returned, and finding them
surrounded by about fifty men, he drew his pistol
and shot one man through the arm. This made
them retire for a moment, but they advanced
again: he then drew another pistol, and shot the
Sheikh of the Yezidees, by name Bella. His
son then rushed on them with the rest, and killed
them all, and with them six other Christians&mdash;two
on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and the others
on mercantile business. The booty they then divided,
half to the people of Telaafer, who were the
guards of the murdered party, and the other half
the Yezidees kept. The Yezidees do not appear
at all to have wished to kill them, knowing
their relation to the Resident here, from whom they
hoped to get a handsome ransom. Perhaps no two
events could more powerfully manifest the weakness
of the Ottoman empire internally than this
event which has happened to Mr. Taylor, and the
pillage of a caravan going to Mousul, which was
stripped of every thing but two boxes of books,
which Mr. Pfander had sent; these they left as
being too heavy, and they are now safe at Mousul.
This caravan was stripped by persons nominally the
subjects of the Pasha within two days journey of
Bagdad, and the property divided with the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
perfect impunity without any attempt at recovery.
These gentlemen were robbed and killed by persons
of a village subject to the Pasha of Mousul;
and he has not the least prospect of bringing them
to punishment.</p>

<p>When Meenas gave the Syrians in Mousul an
account of our school here, they were so much
interested, that all their principal persons have
written a letter to invite us to come there and
establish schools among them, and also to desire
that we should send to them some Arabic Testaments
and Psalms. All this is most encouraging,
and I plainly see, that were there twenty servants
of Christ, faithful men, who would be content to
work for the Lord in every way, there might soon
be found abundant work for them. Mousul seems
especially open to Christian influence. Many of
those immediately connected with the Pasha are
Christians, and many even among the Mohammedans
have still Christian recollections. The letter
from Mousul, Meenas tells us, will come in about
three days; if so, Mr. Pfander proposes sending
back a present of Arabic Testaments and
Psalms, with the expression of our hope that the
Lord may strengthen our hands, as he has made
willing our hearts, to extend our labours unto
them. Major T. often asks me if I think any
missionary mechanics may still come out. The
Lord does so much and so wonderfully, that I can
almost hope this, notwithstanding the host of prejudices
to be first surmounted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Marteroos, the schoolmaster, who we hear is on
his way from Sheeraz, will, I trust, be a great
comfort to us, and a help to the school. He taught
two years in the school at Calcutta, and though
solicited, would receive no salary; and also at
Bushire. This is a trait of character so utterly
unlike these countries, that we cannot but hope
he will enter into our plans with a heartiness that
we can expect few others would. From his understanding
English, we hope he may be able to take
not only the higher Armenian classes, but also to
have time to translate such books as we need for
the use of the school, and also little tracts for circulation.</p>

<p>The Musruff, (or treasurer) of the Pasha told
Major T. that they had begun the canal between
the Tigris and Euphrates. This shews
the Pasha is still anxious about the steam communication.</p>

<p>Our Mohammedan Moolah still continues to
read the New Testament, with the Armenian
schoolmaster, who seems very sanguine that he
will become a Christian. At all events, I bless
God that he sees the record of God with his own
eyes, so that if he now rejects the testimony, it will
be God&#8217;s that he rejects, and not the solemn
mockery of Christ&#8217;s most simple and most holy
truth, which they have before seen.</p>

<p>We were much delighted to find that those of
the little boys who had been exercised in translating
their own language into the vulgar,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
had retained such a clear knowledge of it,
that though they were called upon quite
unexpectedly, they understood it; whereas the
bigger boys, who come to me for English,
and the Moolah for Arabic, and who are
considered to have finished the Armenian education,
were not able to translate one word, at
which they were not a little ashamed, though
the fault was not theirs, but the plan of
education. We are greatly encouraged by this, and
led to hope, with the Lord&#8217;s blessing we shall see,
instead of a system of education, which after
immense labour, terminates in nothing but <em>sound</em>
without <em>sense</em> or instruction, a system that will
at least bring God&#8217;s word before them in a form
intelligible and clear; yea, the very truth that
God&#8217;s Spirit has promised to bless, and which He
has declared shall not return unto him void. Our
schoolmaster fully enters into these plans for
improvement, and really desires to do whatever we
wish. Our Arabic Moolah also enters much into
our wishes, and the boys are making double the
progress they did under the old system. This is
all of the Lord; and in fact, when I think of the
doubts expressed before we commenced of our
being allowed to work at all, and consider the
quietness and peace the Lord has allowed us to
enjoy in the prosecution of our work, I desire
more entirely to cast my whole soul, with all its
purposes and plans on the Lord, not to move but
as he guides.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
The two great objects of the church in the
latter days seem to me to be, independent of
growing herself up into the stature of fulness
in Christ, the publication of the testimony of
Jesus in all lands, and the calling out of the
sheep of Christ that may be imprisoned in all
the Babylonish systems that are in the world.
In both these may the Lord of his infinite mercy
grant success. Oh, how consoling it is, under an
overwhelming sense of powerless inefficiency, to
one&#8217;s work, to know that God has chosen to put
the most precious gift in earthen vessels, that the
excellency of the power may be of God and not of
man, so that we may glory in our very weakness
and ignorance, and natural insufficiency, knowing
that the Lord&#8217;s strength is made perfect in this
very weakness. Dear and blessed Lord, make us
every one willing to be nothing, that thou mayest
in all things be glorified.</p>

<p><em>Oct. 2.</em>&mdash;I have just seen a sight that
interests me much; the Mohammedan Moolah sitting at
one window of the school reading the Arabic New
Testament, and the Armenian vartabiet (or schoolmaster)
sitting at a table explaining to the son of the
priest of this place the New Testament. This young
man is just going to Ispahan to be ordained.
This certainly is something gained, that the word
of eternal truth is brought before them.</p>

<p>In speaking yesterday to my Moolah about the
fortress which the Sultan has ordered to be built
between Damascus and Aleppo, to keep the road
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
safe for caravans, and which is nearly finished, he
told me that the Sultan had promised the European
Sultans that he would govern and regulate
his country like theirs; thus the minds of these
people seem preparing step by step for changes.</p>

<p>I have heard, that after we left Petersburgh,
some of those, from whom we had experienced
peculiar kindness, had become very active in
visiting the poor in the neighbourhood of that city,
and in circulating tracts and the Scriptures, till
at last they attracted the notice of the governors
of one of these villages, who arrested and
examined them. Dr. W. was ordered to leave St.
Petersburgh in twenty-four hours, and the Russian
dominions in three weeks.  Dear young Mr.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;,
being an officer, was put into confinement,
and&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;, whose mother has often visited Africa, has
since left her charge, and is returned to England
for her health, but hopes with increased prospects
of usefulness, to return to her former sphere of
labour. They felt the cause of God had gained
ground during their trials, and that their own
souls had greatly rejoiced in the Lord.</p>

<p><em>Oct. 7.</em>&mdash;We have just heard that a German
watchmaker in this place has turned Mohammedan.
This unprincipled man had a wife and children
in Germany, yet wished to marry a Roman
Catholic Armenian here; but knowing that the
Bishop here would not marry them, he then went
to the Musruff, (the chief officer of the Pasha,)
and promised him that if he would get him this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
woman he would become a Mohammedan, and
this he has now done, and he is using all his
endeavours to compel the young woman he has
married to follow his steps. This, at present, she
resists, but she has little principle, as she knew
before of his being married. The more I see of
this people, the more I am struck with the
necessity of our being made acquainted with the
deep wickedness and corruption of the human
heart, that we may never be hopeless as to these
people, and think them some peculiarly iniquitous
race; and on the other hand, we need a deep
sense of the omnipotence of God&#8217;s Holy Spirit,
that we may never be discouraged; for the bones
are indeed very, very dry. We hear this wretched
man has been beating the woman, finding his
entreaties failed.</p>

<p><em>Oct. 10.</em>&mdash;The Lord has blessed us with a little
girl, and every thing has been ordered by him most
happily, so that we have wanted nothing that the
luxury or wealth of England could supply.  Bless
the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me
bless his holy name; for indeed he daily loadeth
us with benefits.</p>

<p><em>Oct. 14.</em>&mdash;The news of the state of things in
France, and of the Revolution there, has led us to
look up to our Lord to see what the end will be of
these movements.  That they will help on the
coming kingdom of our Lord we know, but how
we cannot yet see. We have also heard not only
that France has taken possession of Algiers, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
is marching towards Tunis. Thus, step by step,
Turkey is being dismembered; and although by
infidel principles and by infidel hands, yet perhaps
preparing the way for the publication of the Lord&#8217;s
love to man. We have also understood that an
English force of 4,000 men, in 200 ships, are
assembled at Malta with the view of attacking
Egypt; but this we do not believe, but regard it
as French news, calculated to bring us, in the
eyes of the Turks, as guilty alike with them in
attacking the Turkish dominions. However, all
these things render our situation here very
profitable, for we know not what a day may bring
forth, and are therefore obliged to look solely
to our Lord. Not that this Pasha cares much,
perhaps, about the taking of Egypt by the English,
or the general reduction of the empire, for such is
the state of this country, that the security of every
little despot depends on the weakness of the
supreme power. Yet notwithstanding this there
may break out paroxysms of popular fury, that
however short are terrible. But the Lord is our
secure and sufficient refuge, and when he has a
people to save&mdash;his chosen ones&mdash;he will put a fear
into the hearts of their enemies. The Revolution
in France seems to be the Infidel against the
Jesuit, or ultra-Papistical party, which may lead
to the removal of the Archbishop of Babylon from
his consular authority, though his ecclesiastical
influence would not, perhaps, be lessened by this.</p>

<p><em>Oct. 17.</em>&mdash;The value of the English protection
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
is beginning here to be so fully understood and
felt, that the first merchant in Bagdad came to
Major T. begging to be taken under it, and
when Major T. declined, he requested that his
son might; and the Seyd, our landlord, in explaining
the reason of his wish for the Resident to take
up his cause, stated, that it was not so much in
order to obtain any present benefit, as that the
government might see that he interested himself
about him; as this, he said, would prevent him being
subject to those oppressions he had been exposed
to before. In fact, I do not believe, that
during the late heavy exactions that have been
made from all degrees and kinds of people, one
individual under English protection has suffered,
or that an attempt has been made to oppress one.
I do not now, or on any other occasion, mention
these events as pieces of political intelligence, but
as necessary to give a view of the signs of the
times. This consideration for the English does
not arise from love, as the most intense hatred is
manifested when it may with safety, as well as
the most unconquerable and haughty contempt of
Christianity and Christians; it seems with this
people of God&#8217;s curse, as with the mystical whore,
they are consuming away in preparation for final
destruction by the brightness of his coming.</p>

<p>Mr. Pfander&#8217;s Persian Moolah has altogether
refused to translate Persian with him. He says
he will read and converse with him, but not translate;
so great is their contempt of Christians, that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
though it is only the Gulistan of Sadi, and therefore
no religious book, they will not teach it. In
fact, the difficulty of getting teachers here is
very great. The Christians know nothing&mdash;the
Mohammedans very little, and what they do know
they will not communicate to a Christian. But
all this is ceasing and must come down.</p>

<p><em>Oct. 18.</em>&mdash;Our hearts have been deeply affected
by a conversation which Mr. Pfander has had
with the Mohammedan Moolah, who teaches our
boys Arabic. He was telling Mr. P. that he was
greatly struck by our Lord&#8217;s precept, not when
you make a feast, to invite the rich or those who
can invite you again, but the poor who cannot;
and that from these considerations he had been led
to invite to an entertainment he had provided, all
the poor persons he knew, to the surprise of his
friends, to whom he explained his reasons. He
also told Mr. Pfander he had often wished he
were an animal rather than a man. There appears
altogether a degree of uneasiness in his
mind that may lead further. Thus God is making
his holy and blessed word a testimony to the hearts
of some; oh! may every success here be such
as bears only the mark of God&#8217;s workmanship by
his word and his Spirit. That there are many
souls here which will feel the power of God&#8217;s
omnipotent word, I can never doubt, when it comes
fully and clearly before them.</p>

<p>The German Jew, whom I have several times
before mentioned, seems determined to become a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
professing Christian. His mind is convinced, but
his heart I fear little, if at all, affected. He abhors
the lying abominations of Judaism, which he
finds among his brethren. He has certainly come
thus far without being induced by any worldly
motives, for had he continued, or would he now
return to live by begging for Jerusalem and writing
lying amulets, he might easily do it. He
wishes to go to Bombay, and there become a
Christian.</p>

<p>We have just heard that one of the boys of
the school and his mother, who took him
away from us, have both become Roman Catholics.
The inducement to these Armenians
is, generally, the pecuniary relief they obtain from
the bishop here, who has the administration of some
funds entrusted to him for religious uses, which
he exclusively gives to Roman Catholics, and
with this he bribes those who can have no other
attachment to their system beyond that which is
hereditary, for in all other things, and in practice,
it would be difficult to say whether of the two were
most corrupt. But we trust, by the good hand of our
God upon us, one day to have different systems of
judgment than that of one corrupt system against
another, even the holy, pure, unadulterated word
of God against the corruptions of all men and all
nominal churches.</p>

<p>We have heard, to our great sorrow, that the
plague has returned again to Tabreez, and that all
have again left it; and also that the cholera has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
again returned to Kerkook, and committed dreadful
ravages. Thus the Lord seems visiting the
kingdoms of the false prophet with his sore
judgments and plagues.</p>

<p><em>Oct. 21.</em>&mdash;There has just been acting here a
scene of duplicity, falsehood, and bloodshed,
which appears strange to us, but is not uncommon
in this land of misrule and cruelty. A Capidji (or
Ambassador) from the Porte to the Pasha has
been long expected, and with evident anxiety by
him and those immediately about him, which was
increased to the highest pitch, when by a messenger
from Aleppo, the Pasha received the intelligence,
that this man&#8217;s intention was to supersede
him, and of course to destroy him. It then became
the object of the Pasha to endeavour to get
him into his hands, which was the more difficult, as
it is usual for the Capidji to read publicly his firman,
and proclaim the successor at Mousul, or some
place near, who, collecting the Arabs, marches to
lay siege to this place, till the head of the Pasha
is delivered to him. To prevent this, therefore,
the Pasha made the Imrahor, or Master of the
Horse, who has the whole arrangement of the
military force, to write a letter to the Capidji, begging
him to come here at once, and that he would,
without a struggle, give the head of Daoud
Pasha into his hand, whereas if he remained at
Mousul, there must be an open contention about it.</p>

<p>By this he was allured to approach the city,
and the Pasha sent out 700 or 800 men under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
pretence of showing him honour, to meet him and
secure him in case any accounts of the true
state of the case should reach him, that he
might have no possibility of flight. Thus he
was brought into the city, and his quarters
appointed in the house of the Musruff; when, after
the Pasha had obtained from him the declaration
of his object, a Divan was called, and it was
determined to put him to death. This event has
thrown the city into great consternation, and every
one who can, is buying corn in expectation of what
is to follow. For the tragedy will not end here,
as a friend of the Capidji is left behind at Mousul,
and another Capidji is at Diarbekr, waiting the
result of this negociation. So it appears that the
Sultan is determined to act at once and decidedly
against this Pasha. We are now, therefore to expect
a siege, and a state of anxiety and fear in this
city for some months; but the Lord, who sitteth
in the heavens, is ordering all for his own glory,
and for our safety, and he will provide for us.</p>

<p><em>Oct. 22.</em>&mdash;We have this day heard that the
Syrian Patriarch of Merdin has recovered one of
his churches from the Roman Catholics, and is, on
the whole, making, in a certain sense, a more
successful stand against them; but not in the
spirit of Christ, I fear. He has two of his priests
who had turned Roman Catholics in prison.</p>

<p>This day our new Armenian teacher has arrived
from Sheeraz. He seems an interesting man;
but our final plans with him are not yet arranged.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
We have also heard that the school at Bushire,
established by Mr. Wolff, is going on badly. He
promised to send out a teacher and money, neither
of which having arrived, the school has dwindled
to seventeen, and these are neglected.</p>

<p>It is the common conversation to-day in the Bazaar
that the Capidji was put to death last night.
This man was the Accountant General of the Porte,
and formerly Kiahya. Our Arabic Moolah has
been buying corn, in the expectation of the present
state of things here terminating in an open contest,
in which he thinks the Pasha, now having no
hope, will throw himself into the hands of Abbas
Meerza, and that thus Bagdad will again become
subject to Persia. Amidst all these wars and
rumours of wars, our path is to sit still and wait
the Lord&#8217;s pleasure, which he will assuredly manifest
to our heart&#8217;s content, for they that wait upon
the Lord, shall not make haste, nor be confounded,
world without end.</p>

<p>Our schoolmaster has come to a full understanding
of the principles on which we intend to conduct
the school: to have nothing that is <em>contrary to
God&#8217;s word admitted</em>, and I think he very fully and
heartily enters into this plan. But he informs us
that the parents of many of the children are
dissatisfied with our superseding the church prayers,
called the Shanakirke, by the New Testament,
and ask, &ldquo;Who are these people? Are they
wiser than our Bishops and ancient fathers, that
we should reject what they introduced?&rdquo; This is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
what we must expect. But we can, with a quiet
heart, leave all to the Lord, to order as he will.
That the schoolmaster is truly on our side I feel
very thankful, and, I hope, the hearts of many
of the children.</p>

<p><em>November 10.</em>&mdash;After having waited now several
weeks for an opportunity to send letters and
a parcel, and not having found any, from the extreme
vigilance there is here to prevent any communications
going to Constantinople, I have determined
to avail myself of the offer of an Austrian
merchant here, to enclose them in a bale of goods
going to Aleppo, and to have them forwarded thence
to Constantinople. It is a great comfort to know
that all the intelligence essential to our cause, as
being God&#8217;s, will reach, and all that is separate
from that, though it may not be against it, is of
little consequence.</p>

<p>We have had two Armenian priests to converse
with Mr. Pfander, one from Nisibin; and the
other from Diarbekr. The one from Nisibin said
they had no printed books among them, and
that they were very anxious to go into the Russian
provinces, but were afraid, since the death of the
Russian Ambassador, to make any attempt to go.</p>

<p>The Armenians seem going from all the Mohammedan
states that they can to Russia. From
Erzeroum, great numbers have gone to the Karabagh,
and thus they may people the desolate provinces
of Georgia. The other Armenian Priest,
from Diarbekr, confirmed the information we had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
previously obtained, that the Armenian population
of that city was 5,000
houses,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
about 25,000 of all
ages, and that they have two schools there, containing
about 300 children, but no one cared about them.</p>

<p>It is now an understood fact, that the Capidji,
or messenger of the Sultan, who was left behind
at Diarbekr, when his companion came on to arrange
the affairs of this Pashalic, is collecting
troops around Diarbekr, to attack Bagdad. This,
however, will most probably be now deferred till
the spring. So we may then expect a siege, unless
things are arranged before. The Capidji who has
been put to death appears to have been a man of
great distinction, and to have rendered great
services to the Sultan, both during the war and
subsequent to it.</p>

<p>The priest of Diarbekr said, they were too far
off to be helped either by the Russians or the
English; but I cannot help thinking, for such a
purpose as schools, or getting through their means
a large body of persons acquainted with God&#8217;s
word, it would be a most important position. It
presents, however, many difficulties, and at all
events would require some time to be spent in some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
place preparatory to settling among them, to obtain
a knowledge of the Turkish and Armenian
languages, and for these preparatory studies,
should there be no determining principle, perhaps
Shushee would be the best position, as the brethren
there all know English, and some Turkish,
and some Armenian.</p>

<p>We are now fast approaching the termination
of our first year&#8217;s residence in Bagdad, and the
Lord&#8217;s mercies towards us have been exceeding
great. We have been surrounded by many things
that would have been dangerous, had not the Lord
checked them by bringing them to nothing, both
from disease and enemies; but, as he promised,
they have not come nigh us. We have borne the
heat without any diminution of natural strength.
We are altogether standing on a more advanced
position, that on entering Bagdad we could have
hoped. Things are in preparation for the knowledge
of God&#8217;s holy word being extended, and
thus one great object of missionary labour is in
the way of attainment. But still, while I feel
assured of there being some choice fruit from here
and there a fruitful bough, I at the same time feel
no less assured, that the great harvest will be of
wickedness, and that the pestilence of infidelity
is the great spreading evil, not the spreading of
Millennial blessedness. As it was in the days of
Noah, so do I believe it will be at the coming of
the Son of Man; and as it was in the days of Lot,
the great mass of mankind will be taunting the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Church with, &ldquo;Where is the sign of his coming?&rdquo;
which shews plainly enough that this will be a
doctrine of the Church in the latter days, or how
should it be reviled; so that our Lord, in
contemplating the general apostacy, said, &ldquo;When
the Son of Man cometh shall he find faith in the
earth?&rdquo; Oh, then, how happy is it to be among
those who love his appearing, who long for the
termination of that dispensation which witnessed
the humiliation of the Church under the world, and
the rise of that glorious kingdom which shall not
be dissolved, and into which no sorrow or sighing
can enter. I feel the languages to be a great
barrier. Whether the Lord will pour down this
among the other gifts of the latter days, I do not
know, but at present it is a great exercise of a
Missionary&#8217;s patience, to ask even for the common
necessaries of life; but to speak out the fulness
of a full heart, so as to be understood and felt is
very, very difficult. The difficulties in the way of
a literary acquaintance with these languages are
by no means so great, as the study may be pursued
alone, but the colloquial language can only be
learned by intercourse with men, and this is far
more difficult to attain by an European, who may
have a very good knowledge of the language
of books, and still be little understood in speaking.
But still the time spent in the learning of a language
among a people, every thought, and purpose,
and habit of whose lives are diverse from
your own, has this advantage, that you become in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
some measure acquainted with their peculiarities
before you are in a situation to offend against them.</p>

<p>We have heard that the Emperor of Russia has
conferred some honours on the family of this Pasha,
who are Armenian Christians, in Teflis. Things
are beginning to look unsettled in Persia.
Contentions have already arisen between the
Prince of Kermanshah and the Prince of Hamadan,
which seems to be but the precursor of a general
state of confusion on the death of the Shah; and
doubtless amidst all these commotions the Lord
will move on his way, and the day of his coming
advance. Oh, may we all labouring abundantly
in patience, wait for that day, that when it does
come we may be found watching.</p>

<p>We have some anxieties about our dear friends
who are journeying towards us. Whether the
intelligence of the state of the Pashalic may deter
them, or whether they will come on, trusting in
the Lord, it is our daily prayer for them, that he
would guide and preserve them.</p>

<p>Our communications with Tabreez seem almost
closed.  Since we received the letter from
Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;, relative to their leaving Tabreez,
and going by this to India, we have neither seen
them, nor heard of them. Whether, therefore, they are
gone by Shiraz, or whether they are detained, we
cannot tell; but the roads will soon become impassable
from snow in the lofty range of mountains
over which they will have to come.</p>

<p>I shall now conclude this portion of our little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
history, with assuring those we love, that the Lord
has been better than all our fears and all our
hopes. The more we have proved him, the more
we have found him to be faithful and gracious,
and that not one of the good things he has promised
to faith has been wanting; but his love has
abounded far beyond our faith, yea, and they will
yet abound more and more. Let us then encourage
one another to prove him more, that we may
have deeper experience of his faithfulness. We
find the prospect of the approaching coming of
our Lord a corrective of the allurements of the
world, and an encouragement to a simple surrender
of all we have as his stewards, to him and his
service, as their only legitimate and worthy object,
who has redeemed us from death with his own
precious blood, making us a chosen generation, a
royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people,
that we might shew forth his praises. Oh! may
the Holy Spirit dwell in us more powerfully, that
we may be ever fulfilling his great and glorious
purpose.</p>

<p>Accounts have just come to us by letters from
Tabreez, that the plague has been ravaging that
devoted city till 23,000 of its inhabitants have
fallen victims to it and the cholera, and that when
this letter came off (Oct. 28), they were still dying
eighteen of a day, and this is not confined to
the city;&mdash;the villages of the surrounding country
have equally suffered; half the inhabitants
have been swept away, the corn has never been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
reaped, and the cattle were wandering about without
owners. The missionaries from America had
not arrived then; most probably they are deterred
by the intelligence of the state of Tabreez. Our
dear friends the N&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s had never enjoyed better
health&mdash;thus preserved of the Lord in the
midst of the general devastation: they are also
for the present, at the request of the Prince, detained
till an answer from the Indian government
is again received respecting them. A famine
seems the inevitable consequence of the plague
and pestilence at Tabreez. Surely these are
among the signs of the times; but the Lord&#8217;s command
to us is, Let not your hearts be troubled.</p>

<p>We have received no intelligence from Shushee,
but we heard from Tartars that the plague had
been in the Karabagh, which makes us additionally
anxious to hear from thence: but doubtless
since the plague at Tabreez, all intercourse with
Russia from that side has been interdicted. Mr.
Zaremba mentioned, that he had to pass through
seven quarantines between Erzeroum and Shushee.</p>

<p>I may also just add, that we have finally arranged
with our new schoolmaster from Shiraz.
We had given particular directions to the person
who proposed sending for him, that if money were
any object to him, (which we heard it was not)
he should write and let us know what he would
require. He however came, and when he came,
he wanted a sum equal to about &pound;84. sterling a year.
This I was both unable and unwilling to give,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and therefore fixed &pound;30. as the utmost, and the
rest has been made up by the Armenians among
themselves, excepting &pound;18. which has been given
by Major T.  He speaks English imperfectly,
but thoroughly understands Armenian, and will
teach the elder boys grammar and translating.
He will also superintend the girl&#8217;s school for one
or two hours in the morning, and teach Mrs. G.
Armenian. We also hope, as soon as may be, to
get some tracts and little school-books translated
into vulgar Armenian, but all this must depend
on the blessing of the Lord on our undertaking.
This brother has joined the Church of England
in Calcutta: but he is himself at present a strict
Armenian, yet I hope, not a bigoted man.
But all our past experience has led us to look to
the Lord alone for all profitable help. Those
whom we think promise every thing, often occasion
nothing but anxiety, and those from whom
we expect the least we have reason abundantly
to bless God for having sent us:&mdash;so wisely, so
graciously, and yet in so sovereign a way does
the Lord bring to pass his purposes, and bless
his servants, that every thought of confidence
in any creature may be destroyed, and the soul,
by a thousand disappointments, when it has reposed
elsewhere, at last be compelled to learn only
to repose on the bosom of its Father, where love
and faithfulness eternally dwell, and convince
the soul of its past expectations from any other
source.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30em;">
<em>February 14, 1831.</em></p>

<p>An offer has been made to us by one of the
richest Armenian merchants here, to send, at his
own expense, two camel loads of books any where
we wish, which has of course been thankfully
accepted; and we think of sending at least one
load to Diarbekr. He has also bought from our
Armenian teacher, those Bibles he had procured
from the Bible Society at Calcutta, who, with the
many thus obtained, has determined to send more
Bibles from Bushire, where he has already 200,
to Julfa and Ispahan, and the villages round about,
in which he says there are above twenty churches.</p>

<p>I have this day settled all my accounts, and
find, after every thing is paid, including the expenses
of my baggage from Bushire, and of the
house for ourselves, and school for another year,
that our little stock will last us, with the Lord&#8217;s
blessing, two months longer, and then we know
not whence we are to be supplied, but the Lord
allows us not to be anxious; he has so wonderfully
provided for us hitherto, that it would be
most ungrateful to have an anxious thought.
Even for my baggage, Major T. only allowed me
to pay half the charge, and he has moreover told
me, that should I at any time want money, only
to let him know and he will lend it me. Now,
really, to find here such kind and generous friends,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
is more than we could have hoped, but thus the
Lord deals with us, and takes away our fears.
That we may many times be in straits I have no
doubt, but the time of our necessity will be the
time for the manifestation of our Lord&#8217;s providential
love and munificence.</p>

<p>There is one peculiar feature that runs through
all education in the eastern churches, that it professes
to be religious, which gives us an opportunity
of introducing such books as may be useful,
without its exciting any surprise or suspicion,
or opposition.</p>

<p><em>Feb. 16.</em>&mdash;The Pasha has sent Major T. word
of the ravages the plague is making in Sulemania.
The government and all who have it in their
power have quitted it. This account has spread
much consternation, in addition to which two men
from Sulemania arrived here ill of the plague, one
of whom has recovered. Major and Mrs. T., with
their usual generous kindness to us, have offered
us an asylum with them should the plague come
here, where we should enjoy this great advantage,
that as the house stands close to the river, a
supply of water can be obtained without communication
with the city. But at present we do not
clearly see our way: should our school be broken
up, I see not so much difficulty; it would be a
most valuable opportunity for Mrs. G. making
progress in the language; but we wait on the
Lord and he will guide us. These do indeed
seem awful times for these lands. We cannot be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
too thankful for the peace and joy the Lord allows
us to feel in the assurance of his loving care.</p>

<p>I was much struck by a remark of our Moolah
yesterday, when speaking of the horror he felt at
the prospect of the plague coming here. He
said, the sword he did not fear, but the plague he
did, for one was the work of man, the other of
God. I replied to him, that feeling this God
who directs the plague, to be my father, who
loved me, I knew he would not suffer it to come
nigh me unless he had no longer occasion for me,
and then it would come as a summons from a
scene of labour and many trials to one of endless
joy. He said, Yes, it is very well for you not to
fear death, who believe Christ to have atoned for
you; but I fear to die.</p>

<p><em>Feb. 19.</em>&mdash;To-day we have heard that the
above report of the plague being at Sulemania is
false; that it has been there, but has now left it;
so we know not what to believe.</p>

<p><em>Feb. 21.</em>&mdash;The expenses attendant on our packages
from Bombay to this place, are as great as
from England to Bombay. The boxes of books
and medicine, and the press, with three boxes of
books from the Bible Society, cost twenty-five
pounds. Aleppo would certainly be the cheapest
way to send them by, and by far the most speedy.
It would be a great comfort to us, if this
communication should ever be opened, for then we
might freely communicate with, and hear from
those we love. I sent a packet across the desert
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the other day, which we have every reason to
think was intercepted. In fact, it is now very
doubtful if any of the many letters we have sent,
have gone safe, and none have reached us for
these six months.</p>

<p>Intelligence came to-day, that the Sultan has
ordered the Pasha of Mosul, and another Pasha
who is dependant on this Pasha, to discontinue all
communication with him, as the enemy of the
Sultan. A few weeks will, most probably, conclude
this long-continued struggle, and, we hope, the
insecurity and confusion attendant on it; yet, the
Lord knows his purposes, and we have only to execute
his will.</p>

<p><em>Feb. 24.</em>&mdash;We have just heard, by a letter that
came from Aleppo by way of Merdin and Mosul,
that the caravan which left this place more than
three months ago, entered Aleppo about thirty
days ago. They remained in the desert till the
Pasha of Aleppo had quitted that place on his
expedition against the Pasha of Bagdad, from the
fear, that if they entered the town he would seize
their camels for the use of his army. Much alarm
is entertained here by the inhabitants as to the
result of this attack. From past experience they
are led to expect great lawlessness, from both
friends and foes. May the Lord keep our hearts
in perfect peace, stayed on him. We now begin
to feel that it is very doubtful when we shall see
our dear friends: certainly no caravan will pass
the desert till all these disturbances are settled.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
It may be also possible, that the journal and
packet of letters I sent packed in a bale of goods
belonging to a merchant here, may yet reach their
destination.</p>

<p><em>Feb. 28.</em>&mdash;This day brought us news of the arrival
of our very dear and long expected friends
and fellow-labourers safe at Aleppo, on the 11th
of January, after many delays and many trials.
We had never been allowed to doubt our Lord&#8217;s
most gracious dealings with us, but yet this
overwhelmed us with joy and praise; and this welcome
news reaches us just as our dear brother Pfander
is on the point of leaving us alone. We received,
at the same time, a packet of letters from most of
our dearest friends in England, at the very moment
when our little all was within a month of
coming to a conclusion, telling us that the Lord
had provided us with supplies for at least four
months to come, which we might draw for. Surely
the Lord has most graciously seen fit to dry up
those sources from whence we anticipated supply,
that we might know we depend on him alone, and see
how he can supply even here; we were ashamed
of every little anxious feeling we had ever had,
and were much encouraged to trust him more and
more. My soul is led to abhor, more and more,
that love of independence which still clings to it,
when I see how it would shut me out from these
manifestations of my Father&#8217;s loving care. Oh!
how hard it is to persuade the rebellious will and
proud heart, that to depend on your Father&#8217;s love
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
for your constant support, is more for the soul&#8217;s
health, than to be clothed in purple and fare
sumptuously every day&mdash;or at least, as we would
say, on bare independence; and yet how plain it
is to spiritual vision.</p>

<p>We met together in the evening to bless the Lord
for the past, and supplicate his continued blessing
for the future&mdash;that he would accomplish what he
had begun, that our hearts may never cease to
praise and bless him. My soul was much comforted,
especially with a text to which one of our
dear correspondents called my attention, Zeph.
iii. 17. &ldquo;The Lord thy God in the midst of thee
is mighty, he will save, he will rejoice over thee
with joy, he will rest in his love; he will joy over
thee with singing.&rdquo; All the letters amounted to
twenty-six, which, after so long an interruption
of all intelligence, was an especial source of joy.
And now we can think of our dear friends definitely
as absolutely at Aleppo, only waiting for the
termination of disturbances to join us.</p>

<p>To-day, a Chaldean, from near Julimerk, came
to see us, and we expect him again, with his
brother, who, he says, can read, when I hope to
obtain from him a fuller account of the state,
numbers, and disposition, of his wild countrymen.</p>

<p>A Mohammedan Effendi was with me to-day;
a very amiable young man, who sees many things
in the customs of his people bad, arising out of the
Mohammedan laws. He came to borrow an Arabic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
bible for, he said, a poor schoolmaster, which
I gladly lent him. Whether it be really for a
schoolmaster, or for himself, I do not know.</p>

<p><em>March 4.</em>&mdash;Read this morning, with peculiar
pleasure, Hawker&#8217;s Evening Portion: &ldquo;How shall
we sing the Lord&#8217;s song in a strange land:&rdquo;
heightened as it was by the localities of our situation;
but above all, by the unity of our experience
with the sentiments of the writer; for we have
indeed found the love of our Father, the pastoral
care of our Elder Brother, and the consolation
and visits of our Comforter, that which has
enabled us to sing the Lord&#8217;s song in this strange
land, even the song of the redeemed.</p>

<p><em>March 13.</em>&mdash;The time is now fast approaching
when we expect the struggle for the Pashalic to
commence, at the conclusion of the Ramazan. Yet
it may all pass over, for the government of
Turkey is so utterly without principle, that by a
well timed application of money, all difficulties
may be surmounted with the Porte, and as the
Pasha seems now disposed to meet this desire, it
may, especially in the present difficulties of the
Sultan with Russia, lead, after all, to an amicable
termination of one year&#8217;s anxiety and suspense.
We are now especially anxious for the pacification
of these countries, that our dear friends may be
able to pass over the desert, as our dear and kind
brother Pfander left us last evening for Ispahan. It
was a great rending to us all, and has left a vacuum we
cannot easily hope to have filled up in all its parts;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
and till our dear brothers and sisters come, we shall
be very solitary, and very much pressed; but our
strength will be as our day. Had he seen it right
to remain I might have crossed the desert to our
dear friends; but this not being the case, it is
impossible for me to leave this, and perhaps in the
present state of things here, from apprehensions
of plague and war, it would have been impracticable
even if he had remained.</p>

<p>Caravans pass much more frequently between
this place and Damascus than between this and
Aleppo, and it appears to me the shorter and
better way of communication to Bayrout and Damascus
to Bagdad than by Aleppo. Three caravans
have passed over the desert from hence to Damascus
within these few months. With one of these an
Armenian with his wife and children went, and
with another several Mohammedan families;
thereby hoping to avoid the troubles they expected
here. So at least we may venture for our Lord
what men venture for their own various interests.
In fact, it does not appear that any further danger
is incurred than that of being plundered, or perhaps
only a heavy exaction from the Arab tribes
through whom the caravan passes, whose interest
it is not to press so hard upon caravans as that they
shall be stopped coming, but to levy a tax upon
them sufficiently considerable to help to support
the tribe.</p>

<p>An English merchant and a Consul are about
settling, if not already settled, at Damascus, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
will still further facilitate communications; and
besides the road from Beyraut to Damascus is
much better than that from Latakeea to Aleppo.
This arrangement, as well as that at Trebisand,
shows that these countries are becoming the objects
of public, or rather mercantile, interest.</p>

<p>A Jew came to borrow an Arabic bible from me
which I have let him have. Another Jew was
with me yesterday, who translated the Hebrew
into Arabic very tolerably; but, generally, they
only learn to read, without understanding what
they read.</p>

<p>An Armenian Priest has just come to ask for
four or five Armenian Bibles, to send to some
villages between Hamadan and Teheran. This is
a plan we like better than sending many to one
place, not only as spreading knowledge further,
but also from the greater probability of their
being read.</p>

<p>We have just seen another of the Chaldeans,
from the mountains. He says that they understand
the Syrian Scriptures; so that at least I
hope to send a letter to the Bishop, with a copy or
two of the Syrian Bible I have with me, that
when they return next year they may bring me
an account whether they understand them or not;
and also it will serve as a means of opening a
personal communication with their chief; as, by that
time it may be possible that one or two of us may
be able to return with these men to the mountains.
As far as their personal assurances go, they promise
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
me a most welcome reception. One of these people
told me, if I would come to his village, he would
kill a sheep for me, and I should have plenty, and
200 walnuts for two-pence; they said every thing
was very abundant there and very cheap. Their
pride seems much gratified by their being the head
and the Mohammedans the tail in the mountains;
so that they cannot open their mouths, or raise
their hands against them.</p>

<p><em>March 15.</em>&mdash;A packet of letters has just arrived
from Shushee, after more than six months
interruption, three days after our dear brother had
left us. However, we got the messenger to set
off immediately to overtake him, and he having
seen the caravan on the way, promised to return
in five days. In this packet I also received one
letter from our dear brother J. B. Dublin, a note
from dear Mr. R. informing me of his having
forwarded the books to the brethren at Shushee.
Surely they are worthy for whom he has done this,
and he will be happy in being thus a fellow-helper
in the truth. Mr. Knill also mentions their arrival
safe at Petersburgh, and his purpose of forwarding
them to Shushee. It has been a year of great
trial at Shushee for the mission, but of exactly
what nature and to what extent we know not, nor
how things now stand in the communications to
our dear fellow-helper who has just left us, as they
are in German; but should he not be able on the
road to write us a full account, he doubtless will
when he has reached Kermanshah or Hamadan.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
We hear that the prince royal is marching
against his brother the Prince of Kerman, by way
of Ispahan, the roads, therefore, are very
unsettled in Persia, but the Lord will encamp
round about our brother and bear him safely
through.</p>

<p><em>March 16.</em>&mdash;The letters we yesterday received
from Tabreez assured us of the willingness of the
Armenian Bishop to have a school as soon as a fit
person could be found; and on reading one of the
tracts from Shushee, he said he would read it in his
church to his flock. Mrs. N. also mentions the
willingness among the Mohammedans to receive the
New Testament, and that in many instances, pleasing
results have manifested themselves; but of what
kind she does not mention. She mentions also one
of the principal Mohammedan merchants asking
for a Testament to read on his road to Mecca.
May the Lord stop him by it before he gets there, at
the gates of the heavenly Jerusalem. In fact, there
is room in these parts for much preparatory work,
when the time comes that the power of the Gospel
shall have taken such root as to show by the power
and individuality it gives to the Christian character
that their craft is in danger. They will do as
they have done in Shushee; but by the Lord&#8217;s
blessing it may then be too late. What appears
to me to require the greatest patience and the
most unwavering perseverance, is the language;
for, while on the one hand there is every thing to
encourage, if we only take the burthen of the day on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
the day, there is such a natural tendency in the mind
of man to accumulate all the difficulties together,
and make one great impassable mountain, that it
becomes more difficult than many would imagine,
to go on successfully and happily like a little child.
That measure of knowledge of a language which
so enables one to move about in the common transactions
of life, does not seem difficult to attain;
but to be able to state clearly the power of moral
distinctions, to detect the fallacy of false systems,
and put beside them the true light of life, is another
and a very difficult thing, but yet the Lord
doubtless sees in this reasons of immense weight,
or he would again bestow upon us the gifts of the
Spirit as before.</p>

<p>God our Father has most marvellously eased
our way, and so great has been the kindness of
our&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash; here, that he would do any thing he could for
us. He even told me the other day, never to let
our work stand still for want of funds, for should
I ever want any he would gladly supply me, and
lend me for my personal wants whatever I might
need. Now when we consider there is but one
English family now resident in Bagdad besides our
own, how like the Lord&#8217;s acting it is to make them
willing to supply to us the necessary help: not
only does the Lord supply us with means necessary
for our expense, but does not allow us when our
little fund gets low, to know the anxiety of expecting,
or thinking what we should do. And,
surrounded as we have been these many months,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
by the alarm of war and the fear of plague or
cholera, even our dear native islands have not
been without their anxieties; but I have been much
struck of late with the peculiar dealings of God
towards his chosen; as of old, the pillar that was
all darkness to the enemy, was light to the church
in the wilderness, so now all this dark cloud, the
darkness of which may be felt, which is spreading
from one end of the Christian and Mohammedan
world to the other, has, towards the church in her
pilgrimage, its full steady bright light surmounted
by &ldquo;Behold he cometh!&rdquo; Blessed assurance!
But a little day of toil, and then we shall come
with him, or rise to join his assembled saints,
dressed all anew, with our house from heaven, that
spiritual clothing meet for the new creature in
Christ Jesus. Oh, what glorious liberty we are
heirs to, as children of God, one day to love our
Eternal Father, Son, and Spirit, with unalloyed
affections, when our whole nature shall be again
on the side of God, and not a place left for the
enemy to put his foot to harass the heir of glory.</p>

<p><em>March 17.</em>&mdash;A Chaldean Roman Catholic priest
has been here to-day, and read me the same passages
of the Psalms in the Chaldean and Syrian
languages, and there appears to be no other difference
than in character, as far as he read. The
Syrians, the Chaldeans, and the Jews, might become
most valuable objects of missionary labour,
not only as being in greater numbers here, but from
the great similarity of their languages, so that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
mastering of the one would be to the mastering of
the three, with very little additional trouble. I
endeavoured to find out from him the difference
between the spoken and written languages, and
as far as he produced illustrations, the difference
was only in pronunciation; the words seemed substantially
the same. But there is a very strong
prejudice to contend with in all those among these
people who know any thing of these languages, in
the contempt in which they hold their vulgar, and
the reverence and sanctity they attach to their old
language, so that I think tracts, in the shape of
paraphrases on particular parts of the Scriptures,
would be exceedingly valuable among them, as
well as tracts generally. I trust we shall be able
to turn our attention to these when we are able,
from our knowledge of the languages, to judge
sufficiently of translations or compositions.</p>

<p><em>March 18.</em>&mdash;This evening the messenger I sent
after Mr. Pfander with the letters from Shushee,
returned with a letter, which I shall here insert,
as it supplies a good deal of information concerning
the dear brethren in the Karabagh.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 20em;">&ldquo;<em>In the Desert near the Village Bakoobah</em>,</span><br />
                <span style="margin-left: 25em;">&ldquo;<em>17th March, 1831.</em></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;My dear Brother,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very much obliged to you, that you
sent this man after me with the letters from Shushee.
He reached us a day&#8217;s journey and a half
from Bagdad.  We advance very slowly, only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
from five to ten English miles a day, on account
of the spring season, when the
Dschervedars<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
feed their horses on grass, and because they
waited for other parties which had yet been behind.
The weather is very fine; we had rain
twice, but only slightly. The remaining time of the
day I spend in reading, and conversation with the
Persians in the caravan. The first day I felt very
solitary, but the second, and since, the Lord afforded
me plenty of opportunity to give testimony of
him who is our Saviour and Lord, and to distribute
several tracts and books among my fellow travellers,
and this rejoiced my heart greatly. According
to the manner of our present travelling we
shall not be in Kermanshah till after twenty days.
They speak in the caravan from fear of the Arabs
after this; but it will be easy for the Lord to
bring me safely through. The caravan is increased
to about 500 horses and 180 persons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now something out of dear Zaremba&#8217;s letters;
but I had only time to read them once over, so
that I am not able to give you any regular extracts
out of them. Should I forget any thing I
will write it from Kermanshah or Hamadan. The
letter was of December last. All had been attacked
with sickness more or less, and dear Brother
Sallett, stationed at Teflis, was called home:
he died of the cholera.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The circumstance with the Armenians is this:
The two deacons did go on in their spiritual life
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
prosperously, and continued to give testimony of
the truth. This excited so much the hatred of
the Armenian clergy against them, that soon after
Zaremba&#8217;s arrival in Shushee from Erzeroum,
the Armenian Archbishop of the Karabagh desired
to have them sent as prisoners to Etchmiazin,
the seat of the Armenian
Catholicos,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
near Erivan. This the Russian Governor of Shushee,
after he was informed of it from Zaremba, did
not allow. So it got a little quiet: but these
young Armenians thought it impossible, at present,
to remain longer in Georgia, and so they prepared
for their departure to Germany. But during this
time the Armenian clergy got an order from the
Russian Governor of Teflis, that the two deacons
should appear before a council in Etchmiazin.
The Governor in Shushee did again so much for
them, that they should go to Teflis, and be allowed
to lay their case before the governor. Zaremba
went with them, though he was not quite well.
The one of these deacons, he who assisted Dittrich
in translation, died there, happy in his Lord.
The other went at last, but in a very good state
of mind and heart, to Etchmiazin, putting his
confidence in his Lord, for whom he was going
to suffer. The brethren had not yet heard more of
him than his arrival there. During the time
Zaremba was at Teflis, the cholera took daily
many away, and some days before his departure,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
our beloved Saltett, as mentioned before. Zaremba
got worse too, but reached Shushee again.
After his arrival, he and Hohenaker, and Dittrich had
been attacked from the cholera, but
recovered again. During this time the person
from Etchmiazin arrived in Shushee, and preached
and spoke against our brethren, and condemned
all the persons who sent their children to them.
So the school was broken up. But now the children
are beginning to collect again, and the school
is again opened. Dittrich was with his family,
yet at Teflis, where Zaremba wrote the letter.
Hohenaker was gone to the German village,
where you stopped, and Haas was kept in
Moscow, in quarantine, because of the cholera.
Two Armenian tracts had been printed in Moscow,
and the copies of the first were already
in Shushee. In Shushee they are printing the
Armenian Dictionary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With our not going to the mountains, they are
quite contented; but they think I should rather
go to Tabreez than to Ispahan, where I might go
at any other time. I do not yet know what I
shall do. I shall see how the Lord will lead me.
But this is clear now, that a long stay at Ispahan
I must give up. Zaremba writes further, that he
has now little hope to be able to go any more on
a journey, and therefore they rather wish that I
should travel and do the Lord&#8217;s work in the
neighbourhood of Shushee, as long as the door is yet
open. I cannot reject this, and so I must for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
present give up my plans for travelling in Persia.
If the way to Ispahan should be quite open, I
would go thither, distribute books, and see that
I might be in Shushee in July; if not, I shall go
direct to Shushee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The case with the mission in Shushee, is now
laid before the Emperor, and so they are waiting
what decision they may receive from thence; but
they are sure that the Lord will direct and order
every thing as it will be best, and therefore are
not discouraged. The Russian government does
not yet in the least hinder them in their work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My letters all arrived safely at Shushee, and
the cause of their not writing, was their own sickness
and the plague all round about them. It does
not seem that one of our letters was lost. Boxes
with Armenian and Persian books are in Tabreez.
They speak good of the Americans. For the news
in your letter I thank you: we live certainly in a
most eventful time, and we have therefore the
more to work so long as it is yet day. May the
Lord mightily bless you, your family, and work.
In him, under every circumstance, we have every
reason to be glad and to rejoice that we have him
on our side.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 20em;">&ldquo;Your affectionate brother,</span><br />
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 25em;">&ldquo;C. G. Pfander.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;P.S. From Alexander
Kasembeg<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
they received
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
a letter which rejoiced them much.  It seems to be good with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other Armenian in
Baku<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
came to Shushee
to be employed in distributing tracts and Bibles.
He has already made a journey into Georgia, and
preaches to Armenians and Turks.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The two dear and most interesting deacons, of
whom one is mentioned as having died in the
faith in his way to suffer for the truth, and the other
has gone to witness alone before his enemies and
persecutors at Etchmiazin, were both in the
school at Shushee, and in the study of and translating
the word of God, had been led step by step,
to see through the errors of the system by which
they were bound.</p>

<p>Another proof of the progress of the same spirit
manifested itself in our infant beginnings. The
two little Armenian boys who live with us, eat
and live as we do; on being asked by the boys
without, why they did not fast as their nation
did for fifty days? without any knowledge or direction
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
from me, they set about selecting from
the New Testament, in conjunction with my own
little boys, those passages which bear on the
question, and which shew that if we eat not we
are none the better, and if we do eat, none the
worse. Remarks of a similar kind have many
times occurred in the course of our translations
from the Testament. At all events, there is a
growing tendency in the minds of the children, to
feel that God&#8217;s word is the one rule on which
they must justify all they impose, and thence the
necessity of understanding it; and these principles
upset at once the whole system of ignorant
mummery which is now called or thought to be the
religion of Jesus here. If it be the Lord&#8217;s pleasure
to spare our lives, and grant us the ability
and opportunity to publish his truth, results will
follow to rejoice our hearts, I have no doubt:
God has declared it shall not return to him void,
nor shall it. And to the Mohammedans also
these converts from among the fallen churches
become invaluable preachers, from their vernacular
facility in the language, and from their being
continually exposed to the question, why they do
not do so and so; they are called upon by the
very necessity of their position to defend with
meekness and wisdom their new position; whereas,
with us, they are satisfied with just simply making
up their minds to this, that theirs is best for them,
and yours best for you.</p>

<p><em>March 20.</em>&mdash;The Moolah yesterday, in speaking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
of the contest between the Pasha and the Sultan,
said, that if the English would guarantee both
sides, both might be satisfied and make peace;
but that if not, they would never believe one
another, for says he, every Osmanli will lie.
This opinion of their own low moral condition, is
universal among Turks and Persians. This man
has often said to me, No Osmanli cares for more
than his own bread, and if that is safe, the whole
empire may be destroyed.</p>

<p>Two tribes of Arabs, whom the Pasha has
brought up to help him in the approaching contest,
in consequence of some feud between them,
came to blows, and all last night and this morning
were firing at one another in that quarter of the
city which is on the other side of the river, where
they are stationed.&mdash;It caused much alarm, and
may be but a precursor to general confusion and
greater trials; but the Lord Jehovah who sitteth
on the everlasting hills, is our shield and defence.
The firing has since ceased, and one of the tribes
has been driven out of Bagdad.</p>

<p><em>March 21.</em>&mdash;This day the packet of letters came
by Bombay, which were sent off about four months
after we left, and therefore have been about
eighteen months on the road. The best way is
to put all letters into the post-office, paying the
postage, and they will then come generally in
about eight months by Bombay, free of all expense
but that paid in England; and it would
afford us peculiar pleasure if our dear friends
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
would write regularly by this route, for the opportunities
by Constantinople are either rare or expensive.</p>

<p>How strikingly do these letters prove the truth
of our Lord&#8217;s declaration, that those who leave
father or mother, &amp;c. for his sake and the gospel&#8217;s,
shall find a hundred fold, fathers, mothers, brothers,
sisters, houses, lands, with persecutions.
Surely we are rich indeed, in the love of the saints
of our Lord, and in their prayers for us. These
letters prove that our weak childish faith has not
been without the Lord&#8217;s blessing on his own work.
Oh! then, what might be expected if we had been
strong in the Lord and in the power of his might?
Perhaps, however, he who has led us hitherto,
insignificant as we are, may lead us onward still
to magnify his grace in our weakness. Surely no
missionaries, with so few pretensions to the love
and confidence of the church of God, ever received
more solid proofs of deep and hearty interest
than we have during these ten months; this
is no small point gained, and I think we may go
further, and add, that many have been led by this
weak effort of faith in us, to take steps they might
not otherwise have ventured upon. I do not desire,
for one moment, to set myself in opposition
to those blessed institutions whose labours roused
us from our lethargy: but only this I must say,
that I do not think their plan is the best, or the
only good one.  Notwithstanding, I desire to
bless God for them, and to co-operate with them,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
whenever I can. I do rejoice, with most unfeigned
joy, at any honour God bestows upon them, and
I should rejoice to see them multiplied a hundred
fold; for whosoever brings a stone to the temple of
our Lord and king, by whatever different means
they may have laboured with from ourselves, shall
be our father, mother, sister, brother. The only
end we know of existence is the manifestation of
that temple, and may the king&#8217;s blessing and
favour rest on the head of every one who labours
for it, at home or abroad, under established
institutions, or in any other way. By all, Christ is
preached, and God the Father glorified, and the
power of the Holy Ghost manifested. Unprofitable
servants as we are, weak in faith, and infirm
in purpose, except as the Lord day by day lifted
us up, as it were, with one hand, and covered us
with the other, and enabled us to stagger on our
way; still, we cannot but feel that the Lord&#8217;s
goodness and care, which our weakness has elicited,
may have moved in some small degree the
hearts of the little band of six, who are coming
to join us; and I hear that their simplicity and
faith has yet further stirred up the spiritual affections
of others to go and do likewise&mdash;but these
are early days; if it be of the Lord, he will bless
it; if not, we desire to be the first to lay our hands
on our lips, and our faces in the dust, saying, We
were deceived; the cause is the Lord&#8217;s, not ours;
with him we will leave its prosperity and defence.</p>

<p><em>March 28.</em>&mdash;The plague has now absolutely, we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
believe, entered this unhappy city. Major T. and
all those connected with the residency are preparing
to leave for the mountains of Kourdistan;
they have most kindly invited us to go with them
and form part of their family; this is most truly
kind, and there are many things to recommend it&mdash;the
opportunities it would afford M. for learning
Armenian, and me Arabic, and for observation
on the country and people, besides our being
delivered from all apparent danger either from
the sword which threatens us from without, or
the pestilence within. The absence of all these
friends and so many of the principal Christian families
who are going with them, leaves us exposed
to the bigotry of the people in any tumults that
may arise&mdash;all these things presented themselves to
our minds. But there are considerations that outweigh
these in our minds: in the first place, we
feel that while we have the Lord&#8217;s work in our
hands we ought not to fly and leave it; again, if
we go, it is likely that for many months we cannot
return to our work, whereas the plague may cease
in a month; opportunities of usefulness may arise
in the plague that a more unembarrassed time may
not present; and our dear friends from Aleppo
may come and find no asylum. The Lord gives
great peace and quietness of mind in resting under
his most gracious and loving care, and as the great
object of our lives is to illustrate his love to us,
we believe that in the midst of these awful circumstances,
he will fill our tongues with praise as he
does fill our hearts with peace.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
I have just heard, that some Englishmen have
been circulating tracts at Julfa, an Armenian town
in the neighbourhood of Ispahan, and that the
bishop has prohibited their circulation; this shews
what we have to expect.</p>

<p>I believe I have many times mentioned the deeprooted
opposition which exists among the clergy and
literary men in the East, to having any thing translated
into the vulgar dialects: they are worse
than the literati of Europe used to be with their
Latin, many among whom, but lately came to see
that it was no disgrace to communicate their ideas
in a vernacular dress: as the common sense of
mankind has triumphed over the literary pride of
the learned, so we shall find that babes will one
day overthrow the literary pride of these orientals.
I obtained, the other day, a translation of one of
Carus Wilson&#8217;s little stories, into the vulgar Armenian
of this place, for the little girls. The contrast
between the effect produced by reading this
in an intelligible language, and their usual lessons,
was most striking: in the one there is of necessity
a perfect indifference; but on reading the other,
they begged and entreated they might have it to
carry home, which is promised them for next week.
Of this I had no doubt before; but the experiment
has been most gratifying and encouraging.</p>

<p><em>March 29.</em>&mdash;Yesterday Dr. Beagrie and Mr.
Montefiore went and saw several patients they
thought afflicted with the plague; but their minds
were not perfectly made up. To-day, there is no
longer any doubt. I accompanied Mr. Montefiore,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
in his visits, and now there are about twenty, and
the number is increasing. Thus, then, this long
expected scourge has visited this city, and our
Father only knows when the awful visitation may
cease. We can only cast ourselves on his holy
and loving hands for safety or peace: into these
hands we do cast ourselves, with all that is dearest
to us in this world. We have proved our Jesus
to be the Captain and Author of our hopes, and
always found that in the power of his name we
have obtained the victory. Nothing but the
Lord&#8217;s loving pity can prevent the most awful
extension of the disease; not only are the people
crowded together, two or three dying in one room,
but the intercourse is perfectly unrestricted in all
parts of the city, so that I fear what is now confined
to one quarter, and might possibly, by a
vigilant government be kept there, is spreading
in all directions. We have, therefore, been forced
to the most painful step of breaking up our school,
for it would have been quite impossible to collect
together eighty children from different parts of
the city, without exposing all to danger. May
the Lord enable us profitably to avail ourselves of
our retirement, to cultivate a more extended communion
with him who is our life. Dear M. is much
staid on her God, and feels that as he has been,
so he will be to us a hiding place in every storm.</p>

<p><em>April 1.</em>&mdash;The plague is still increasing, but
apparently not rapidly. We wait the Lord&#8217;s pleasure
in our own house. The only inconvenience
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
is want of water, which cannot be had from without;
and they say that when the plague becomes
intense all the water carriers cease to ply; but the
Lord hath said, in the time of famine ye shall be
satisfied; on this promise we rest in peace.</p>

<p>Two English gentlemen set off to-morrow across
the desert with a single guide to Damascus, to examine
the means of communication by water between
the Mediterranean and Aleppo. From
thence, should they be spared, they purpose
going to Beer, and thence pass down the Euphrates
with the view of ascertaining its fitness for
steam navigation. Surveys have already been
completed between this and Bussorah, of both the
Tigris and Euphrates, by Mr. Ormsby, in part
assisted by Mr. Elliot, and from Ana to Felugia
by Captain Chesney of the Royal Artillery, and
there remains between Beer and Ana to be examined.
Through all that has yet been surveyed
there is no obstruction, but it is expected there
will be a little labour required in one or two points
of what remains to be surveyed, before steam
communications could proceed on the rivers. If
these gentlemen thus labour for what perishes in
the using, and run such risks, going as they are
across the desert with a guide, whose language
they do not understand, ought it to be called tempting
God, in us going for such a work as ours is, to
run similar risks and encounter similar dangers.</p>

<p>The deaths at present from the plague are confined
to the Mohammedans and the Jews. To
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
avoid it, many of the Jews have gone to Bussorah,
and the Kourds who brought it here have fled
from the city; a large caravan of Christians are
now thinking of returning to Mosul, who were
driven from Mosul three or four years ago by
plague and its attendant famine.</p>

<p>The poor Jews have been robbed of every thing
by the Arabs, and sent naked back, and there
seems little better prospect for those who are going
to Mosul: they have the Arabs on one side the
road, and the Kourds on the other.</p>

<p>It is striking how fully and simply the Mohammedans
admit the expected coming of our Lord
and the end of the world. The end of our Lord&#8217;s
coming they conceive to be to set his seal to Mohammed&#8217;s
mission, and that all Christians will become
Mohammedans. Still these fundamental
errors in their views do not prevent a clear and
distinct expectation similar to that of the heathen
at the time of our Lord&#8217;s coming. Certainly no
people can have a worse opinion of the state of
the professors of their religion than the Mohammedans
have; still, with the loss of zeal for their
own, their heart seems full of a strong delusion to
believe a lie, and hate the way of life, and above
all, the Lord who is the true God and eternal life.</p>

<p>How blessed the 91st Psalm feels at such moments
as these, in looking round on one&#8217;s little
family, to know that every arrow that flies, winged
with death, is no random shot, but that the Lord
who is your life, and by whom your life is hid in
God, directs them all. Call upon me, says the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Lord, in the day of trouble, and I will deliver
<em>thee</em>, and thou shalt <em>glorify me</em>. Blessed Lord,
when thou hast (as thou most assuredly wilt do)
delivered us, may we never forget to glorify and
bless thee. Oh! what a blessed feeling it is to
know that you are not under the general but
especial and particular government of Jehovah&mdash;that
he has redeemed you, and you are his&mdash;that
he has engraven you on the palms of his hands; and
that day and night he is watching to preserve you.</p>

<p><em>April 3.</em>&mdash;An immense crowd of poor Jews left
the city this morning, to escape the destruction of
the plague. The Christians also are leaving in
every direction they can find open. I fear these
poor creatures in their flight can hardly fail to
carry the plague with them.</p>

<p>I have lately read several of Erskine&#8217;s works, or
little portions of his writings, and never did I see
the pernicious effects of system displayed more
legibly than in several of his most interesting, but
as a whole, most delusive publications. In his
view of Gospel freeness, and other places where
similar views to those contained in that little work
are promulgated, there seems, to my mind, a
radical defect, that nothing in so good a man accounts
for but the baneful effects of a system,
and a secret insurmountable repugnance to the
sovereignty of God&#8217;s government, and the individuality
of God&#8217;s election in Christ Jesus, from
before the foundation of the world. I do not
mean that these doctrines are denounced; but
they evidently are not entertained as the comfort
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and consolation of the soul, nor as they are represented
by the Apostles, as the most overwhelming
reasons for unlimited devotion to his service, who
has thus chosen us with our bodies, souls, and
spirits, which are his.  He talks of spreading
the beauty of the Lord Jesus, and the excellency
of God&#8217;s love, not only as the pasture of their souls,
who are born again of the Spirit, of which they
undoubtedly are the legitimate, the only food and
means of their spiritual growth, but as the cause of
spiritual life in the unregenerate by being believed.
Now, this appears to me a radical and fundamental
error. Food does not give life, though it sustains
and expands it. What he says of the effects
of love, in moulding the soul to the likeness of the
object beloved, is most true; but in order to the
existence of this love, not merely faith in God&#8217;s love
seems to be necessary, nor the reality of the things
promised, but such a new creation in the soul, as
shall see a desirableness in it and them. As we
see in nature, when the heart is engaged by one
object of affection, any demonstration of affection
from another, which involves the relinquishment of
it, not only does not give pleasure, but positive
pain, though you know its reality, purity, and intensity;
the fact is, the affections are occupied,
and there is no place. So it is by nature with
every man, and while he remains in this state, no
knowledge of love, however real, intense, and
devoted, when he sees its tendency to disconnect
him from the only source of known enjoyment, by
the substitution of that which he has no senses to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
appreciate, will ever be found available. It appears
to me, that the spiritual immortal generation
of the second Adam, the Lord from heaven,
is in Scripture represented to be as real and absolute
as the generation from our earthly head,
and only invisible from being spiritual. It has its
proper food, its proper growth. Without being
thus begotten from above, though you could display
all the beauties of him who is the chief among
ten thousand, the altogether lovely, though you
could display all the Father&#8217;s love to the church
from the day he commanded his gathering it, till
this day, it would be as powerless as spreading
the most sumptuous banquet before the dead.</p>

<p>With respect to the general design of vindicating
the government of God from the charge of
partiality, which I feel to be at the bottom of Mr.
Erskine&#8217;s views, I do not see that the Lord has
committed it to us, but, whenever in the Old
Testament or in the New, he pleads with his
children against their ingratitude, it is from the
specialty of his love. He does not say to the Israelites,
I have dealt with you after a common
dealing with all; but, with what nation has the
Lord dealt as with Israel. So, in the New, he
says, &ldquo;I have chosen you, not you me.&rdquo; In the
prayer of our Lord, in John xvii. in the Epistles of
Paul and Peter&mdash;in the Revelations, and so in all
the called and chosen, and faithful, who are written
in the Lamb&#8217;s book of life, and have been from
the foundation of the world, from the beginning
to the end, I see a constant reference made, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the warmest and most enlarged attachment of the
affections demanded, on the ground of peculiar,
especial, and personal choice on the part of God.
That all this is consistent with every perfection of
God&#8217;s character, and, therefore, with his equal
justice and mercy, I have the fullest assurance,
but that we are in possession of the means of
shewing it, or that the Lord requires it at our
hands, I feel fully assured of the contrary. And
the danger Mr. E. seems to apprehend from stating
the doctrines of election as they are usually stated,
are more imaginary than real. For God, who by
his Holy Spirit begets the soul again in the likeness
of the divine nature, gives to that nature thus begotten
the power of discriminating in its food between
night-shade and sweet pasture.&mdash;When he
has created in the soul of any human being the love
of himself, he gives him, with this love, the privilege
to rejoice that his name is written in heaven, and
the minister of Christ is by no means embarrassed
by all these apparent difficulties, for he has to display
all the beauty of Christ, all the love of the Father,
all the graces of the Spirit before the assembled
world, knowing that all the sheep will hear,
and feed, and grow, and that the goats will cavil
and stamp down the pasture with their feet. But,
ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep,
as I said unto you, My sheep hear my voice and
I know them, and they follow me. Again, he
that is of God hath God&#8217;s words, ye therefore
hear them not, because ye are not of God. How
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
and why this is we are not able nor willing to try
to answer: all we can say is, hath not the Lord
right to do what he will with his own. Shall the
thing formed say to Him that formed it, &ldquo;What
makest thou?&rdquo; And &ldquo;Shall not the Judge of all
the earth do right.&rdquo; And many, many more like it.</p>

<p><em>April 4.</em>&mdash;We were last night alarmed by the
voices of apparently thousands of persons on the
other side of the river; by degrees the discharges
of guns were mingled with the cries, which gradually
extended also to this side the river. We concluded
it must be from a tribe of Arabs having
broken into the city, the noise being exactly similar,
only much more violent, to that of the two tribes
of Arabs who were contending the other day. But
after an hour&#8217;s suspense, we heard it was a concourse
of Arabs to supplicate from God the removal
of the plague from them.</p>

<p>The deaths from the plague do not seem to increase
with any rapidity, these two or three days;
150 perhaps is the highest any day. On a preceding
occasion, about 60 years ago, it amounted
to near 2000 a day. There is with us the father
of our schoolmaster, who had the plague at that
time, and says you might have walked from one
gate of the city to the other, and hardly have met a
person or heard a sound. We trust it may be the
Lord&#8217;s gracious purpose to take off the heaviness
of his judgment, and spare yet a little longer this
sinful city.</p>

<p>The news from Europe also&mdash;how strange&mdash;how
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
anxious; surely the Lord seems sifting the nations,
and shewing their rulers that without the Lord&#8217;s
blessing their confidences, plans, and speculations,
can never stand. That they should have discovered
also that the spiritual and temporal character
of the Pope&#8217;s government are incompatible&mdash;surely
these are signs in the times that may
make the most sceptical enquire. Oh! how joyful
a thought it is that the Lord is at hand, and
our pilgrimage near ending.</p>

<p><em>April 7.</em>&mdash;We had thought the Lord had removed
the sword from us, but we hear it is now
near at hand; and the plague seems extending, or
every one is running away. Sometimes, on looking
round on our dear little circle, the old heavy
faithless flesh would seek its quiet, sheltered
retreat under the lofty elms, but the Lord never
allows the spirit for one moment to desire otherwise
than to wait and see the salvation of our God,
who will for his name&#8217;s sake do wonderfully for us,
that our hearts may rejoice in him. We hear the
enemy is within three days of the city, and the Pasha
is going out with all his Haram, whether to contend
or fly we do not know, but we think from his character,
the latter; but where shall he fly? If he
flies with gold, there are those who will plunder
him: if he flies without, he cannot stir a step.
In fact, the moment his affairs are actually sinking,
all the miserable elements of his present comparative
strength turn against him.</p>

<p><em>April 9.</em>&mdash;Stillness still prevails over the city,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
like the calm which precedes a convulsion; our
neighbours are preparing for defence, by getting
armed men into their houses, but we sit down
under the shadow of the Almighty&#8217;s wings, fully
assured that in his name we shall boast ourselves.
The Pasha, however, has not gone out as he intended
yesterday.</p>

<p>We have just heard that the reports of the
plague has stopped for a little the approach of the
enemies of the Pasha, still every thing is exceedingly
unsettled. He is going to shut himself up in
the citadel till the answer comes from Constantinople
to his overtures, but all those about him are
against him, and wishing for the arrival of his
enemies. About fifty went out the other day,
and seized on
Hillah,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
but they were driven out.</p>

<p><em>April 10.</em>&mdash;The Lord has in many respects this
day altered our position here. One of Major Taylor&#8217;s
seapoys has died of the plague, and now four
of the servants are attacked. This has so alarmed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Major T. and the family, that they are immediately
going off to a country house, built by order
of the Government of Bombay, for the Resident
in the neighbourhood of Bussorah, and they may or
may not return to this place. They have kindly
offered us an asylum with them, and a passage
in their boat. Having no immediate occupation
here at present, I feel quite free to accept it,
but there are considerations that prevent us.&mdash;Hitherto
the Lord has kept us safe, and no symptom
of plague has appeared in our dwelling&mdash;though
it is all around us. We cannot move without
coming in contact with numbers of people for
many days, and being shut up in a small boat with
the Arab
sailors,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
and even the very plague we may
leave this city to avoid, may have reached Bussorah
before we arrived there, as thousands have
already set off from hence for that place; besides
which, should it be the Lord&#8217;s pleasure that the
plague terminate soon, and we then wish to return,
it may be many months before we may meet
with an opportunity. The only advantage seems to
be, that we should thus be apparently further removed
from those troubles which seem likely to arise
in the threatened attempt to depose this Pasha;
yet, on the whole, we feel we may hold on with
the Lord&#8217;s blessing; but if we were once to leave
our present post, it might be very difficult again
to regain it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
The accounts brought us of the numbers of those
who have died of the plague, on this side of the
river alone, in little more than one fortnight, all
agree in making it about 7000. The poor inhabitants
know not what to do: if they remain in
the city, they die of the plague; if they leave it,
they fall into the hands of the Arabs, who strip
them, or they are exposed to the effects of an inundation
of the river Tigris, which has now overflown
the whole country around Bagdad, and destroyed,
they say, 2000 houses on the other side of
the river, but I think this must be exaggerated;
the misery of this place, however, is now beyond
expression, and may yet be expected to be much
greater. Dreadful as the outward circumstances
of this people are, their moral condition is infinitely
worse; nor does there seem to be a ray of
light amidst it all. The Mohammedans look on those
who die of the plague as martyrs, and when they
die there is no wailing made for them; so that
amidst all these desolations there is a stillness,
that when one knows the cause is very frightful.
The Lord enables us to feel the blessedness of the
91st Psalm, at least of the portion of those to
whom that Psalm pertains; and we have, amidst
all these very trying circumstances, a peace that
passeth understanding. We feel indeed that we
owe it to our Lord&#8217;s love to be careful for nothing,
neither to run or make haste as others, but to
stand still and see the salvation of our God.</p>

<p>There was a curious conversation going on last
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
night, among some Mohammedans, outside our
window, relative to the plague, which they said
was an especial judgment on them and the Jews,
but from which Christ would deliver the Nazarenes,
and in all these calamities, it is remarkable
how doubly heavy, they fall on these two classes.
Feelings like these, and others that we know
exist, make us clear to stay where we are in the
midst of these judgments, trying as they are to
natural feeling. That which comes to the ungodly
<em>as judgments</em>, comes to the child of God, like the
chariot of fire to Elijah. From these visitations
as judgments, we have an especial promise of protection,
and we trust in the midst of them some
good may spring up; at all events, we feel that we
shall have quite met our dear Lord&#8217;s mind in giving
this people a last opportunity of hearing, ere
their house is left unto them desolate.</p>

<p><em>April 12.</em>&mdash;I have just taken leave of the kind
T.&#8217;s. The accounts of the dead are truly terrific;
they say the day before yesterday 1200 died, and
yesterday Major T.&#8217;s man of business obtained a
receipt to the amount of 1040 on this side of the
river. If this statement can be relied on, the mortality,
within and without the city, must be truly
appalling, and should it not please the Lord soon
to stay the destroying Angel&#8217;s hand, the whole
country must become one wide waste. Some very
kind Armenians<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
have offered to provide what is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
necessary for our journey to Damascus, if we will
go with them. The possibility of meeting our
dear Brethren is a great temptation, but still we
do not see clearly our permission to go, and the
Lord has given us all such perfect peace in staying,
and such perfect health, that we are even
unwilling to go; we remain, therefore, and wait
upon our Lord&#8217;s love, which we feel assured will
be manifested towards us amidst this scene of
death; and afterwards we shall see why we remained,
more clearly perhaps than now.</p>

<p><em>April 13.</em>&mdash;The plague has just entered our
neighbour&#8217;s dwelling, where they have collected
together nearly thirty persons, not simply their
own family. It seems as if a spirit of infatuation
had seized them, for instead of making their number
as small as possible, they seem to congregate
as many together as they can.</p>

<p>Oh! what a blessed portion is ours, to have the
God of Israel and his unchangeable promises for
our sure and abiding place of rest&mdash;our little
sanctuary unto which we may always resort. Yea,
in the secret of his pavilion he will hide us.</p>

<p><em>April 14.</em>&mdash;This is a day of awful visitation.
The accounts of deaths yesterday vary from between
1000 and 1500; and to-day, they say, is
worse than any, and the increase in the numbers
of deaths is exclusive of the immense multitudes
who are dying without the city. One of our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
schoolmasters<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> is gone to Damascus, and has
taken with him his little nephew who was boarding
with us, so we are indeed now quite alone.
In fact, nothing prevents the entire desertion of
the city, but the dangers of the way, and the poverty
of the inhabitants.</p>

<p><em>April 15.</em>&mdash;The accounts of the mortality yesterday
still more alarming&mdash;1800 deaths in the
city. There was great danger of the bodies being
left in the houses, and the inhabitants flying and
leaving them unburied, but by great exertions on
the part of some young men in one quarter of the
town to bury the dead there, others have been
stimulated in other quarters to similar exertions,
and last night all were buried. Our Moolah has
just been here; he says he has bought winding
sheets for himself, his brother, and his
mother.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
He says that yesterday he was in the Jew&#8217;s quarter,
and only met one person, and that was a woman,
who, when she saw him, ran in and locked
the door. Meat, for some days, or any thing else
from without, we have been unable to get. Water
alone we have obtained. But, to-day, even that
we cannot get at any price; every waterman you
stop, answers he is carrying it to wash the bodies
of the dead.</p>

<p><em>April 16.</em>&mdash;The accounts of yesterday are worse
than any day, and an Armenian girl, who has been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
here this morning, said she saw, in a distance of
about 600 yards, fifty dead bodies carrying to
burial. The son of Gaspar Khan, our next neighbour,
is dead. Two have been carried out from
a little passage opposite our house to-day, where
two more are ill. All you see passing have a little
bunch of herbs, or a rose, or an onion to smell to,
and yet as to real measures of precaution there has
not been one step taken; not even contact avoided,
and the most unrestrained intercourse goes on in
every direction, so that nothing but the Lord&#8217;s arm
shortening it, can prevent the entire desolation of
the whole province. The population of Bagdad
cannot exceed 80,000, and of this number more
than half have
fled,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
so that the mortality of 2000
a-day is going on among considerably less than
40,000 people. But the Lord tells us, when we
hear or see these things, not to have our hearts
troubled, for our redemption draweth nigh; and
we believe it, and accept it as a sweet drop in the
bitter cup that is now drinking to the very dregs
by so many about us; and which, but for this expectation,
would bow down the stoutest heart.</p>

<p>One of Major T.&#8217;s servants has just been here,
who says the city is a perfect desert, only peopled
by the dead, the bearers of the dead, and the
water carriers. Our household are all in perfect
health, thanks be to our loving Shepherd&#8217;s care.</p>

<p><em>April 17.</em>&mdash;To-day, as yesterday, we have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
heard nothing as to numbers. The accounts are
very contradictory; some saying that there is very
little plague, others, that it is heavier than any
day; so that probably, in some parts of the city,
it is very severe, and in others lighter.</p>

<p>An Armenian told the schoolmaster that almost
every one you meet is carrying cotton and things
for the interment of the dead. We are left almost
alone in our own neighbourhood, all having fled in
one direction or another; we have been, however,
all preserved in health, to the praise of the Keeper
of Israel.</p>

<p>Surely every principle of dissolution is operating
in the midst of the Ottoman, and Persian empires.
Plagues, earthquakes, and civil wars, all
mark that the days of the Lord&#8217;s coming are at hand,
and this is our hope&mdash;on this our eyes and hearts
rest as the time of repose, when all these trials shall
cease, and the saints shall possess the kingdom.</p>

<p><em>April 18.</em>&mdash;To-day the accounts are truly distressing.
In the family of one of our little boys,
consisting of six, four are laid down with the
plague, father, mother, one son, and one daughter&mdash;only
one son and a daughter remaining. Immense
numbers of families will be altogether
swept away, and many thousand of fatherless and
motherless children left when this heavy judgment
of God ceases. It is now become useless to attempt
obtaining accurate accounts about numbers.</p>

<p><em>April 19.</em>&mdash;Still heavy, heavy news. The
Moolah has called to give us an account of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
city. He says it now stands stationary at between
1,500 and 2,000 a-day, and has been so for a
fortnight. What a mass of mortality! Among
the Pasha&#8217;s soldiers, he says they have lost, in
some of the regiments, above 500 out of 700.&mdash;And
in the towns and villages without, the report
is, that it is as bad or worse than within the city.</p>

<p><em>April 20.</em>&mdash;The plague much the same. Among
the Armenians nine were buried yesterday, and
seven to-day. There are not left in the city more
than 400, and now there is the plague in every
third or fourth house. The water also is increasing,
so that a little more will inundate the whole
city on this side the river, as it has on the other,
to the inexpressible additional misery of the poor
people. The caravan which left for Damascus
can neither advance nor return on account of the
water. Yesterday four dead were carried out
from the little passage opposite our house, making
in all 14 dead from eight houses, and there are
others now lying ill.</p>

<p><em>April 21.</em>&mdash;To-day the accounts of the plague
are rather more favourable, though another has
been carried out from the passage opposite us, and
there are some ill in three houses adjoining ours.
The river has burst into the cellars of the Residency,
and is within a foot of inundating the whole city.</p>

<p><em>April 22.</em>&mdash;Having had occasion to-day to go
out to the Residency, to endeavour to save some
things from the water, which has come into all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
the cellars, in every way I was overwhelmed with
the awful state of the city, and at the difficulty
of obtaining help of any kind at any price. The
servant of Major T&mdash;&mdash;, who is left in charge
of the house, told me he had applied in every
direction, but could get no one to help him; one
had a wife dead or dying, another a mother,
another was employed in carrying water for the
dead, and on our way, we saw the Court of the
Meshid or Mosque full of graves; and no longer
finding room there, they were burying the dead
in the public road. When in want of water, I
think we shall be obliged to go to the river and
fetch it for ourselves, as a water-carrier is hardly
now to be seen, except when followed by a man
forcing him to carry water to some house where
there is death. Amidst all, the Lord lets not
his destroying angels enter our dwelling; though
tens of thousands are falling around us, we are
all, by his grace and holy keeping, well. The
business of death is now come to that height,
that people seem to take their nearest relations,
and bring them for interment with as much indifference
as they would transact the most ordinary business.</p>

<p><em>April 23.</em>&mdash;The plague not decreasing; two more
were brought out to-day from the passage opposite
to us, making seventeen from eight houses near us.
The mother of the Seyd, who owns our house, has
been buried in her house, as no one could be
found to bury her. Another most affecting instance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
has just occurred. A little girl of about
twelve years old was seen carrying an infant in
her arms, and being asked whose it was, she said,
she did not know, but had found it in the road,
having heard that both its parents were dead.
Water now is not to be had for money; yet even
in these times Israel&#8217;s pillar has its bright side
to Israel. These things must come to pass; but
when we see these signs, we must remember that
our redemption draweth nigh; and the Lord will
be a little sanctuary for us, let him send however
sore judgments on the earth.</p>

<p><em>April 24.</em>&mdash;The plague still raging with most
destructive violence; the two servants in our next
neighbour&#8217;s house are both dead, and two horses
left, I fear, to starve. A poor Armenian woman
has just been here, to beg a little sugar for a
little infant she picked up in the street this morning;
and she says, another neighbour of her&#8217;s
picked up two more. They have just been
digging graves beside our house. Almost all the
cotton is consumed, so that persons are wandering
all over the city to find some, for burying their
dead. Water not to be had at any price, nor a
water-carrier to be seen. Oh, what heart-rending
scenes sin has introduced into the world! Oh,
when will the Lord come to put an end to these
scenes of disorder, physical as well as moral? In
one short month, not less than 30,000 souls have
passed from time to eternity in this city, and yet,
even now, no diminution apparently of deaths.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Surely the judgment of the Lord is on this land?
One more taken from the little passage opposite,
making nineteen from the eight houses.</p>

<p><em>April 25.</em>&mdash;To-day, three more from the same
passage, making twenty-one from these houses.
Such a disease I never heard of or witnessed;
certainly not more than one in twenty recovers;
every one attacked seems to die.</p>

<p>This has been a heart-rending day. The accounts
from the Residency, and the falling of a wall,
undermined by the water, obliged me to go out, and
I found nothing but signs of death and desolation;
hardly a soul in the streets, unless such as were carrying
the dead, or themselves affected with plague,
and at a number of doors, and in the lanes, bundles
of clothes that had been taken from the dead, and
put out. The Court of the Mosque was shut,
having no place left for burying, and graves were
digging in every direction in the roads, and in
the unoccupied stables about the city. The water
also has increased so much as to be within a few
inches of inundating the city. Should this further
calamity come on this side, as it has on the other,
the height of human misery will be near its
climax, for where they will then bury their dead
I know not. There seems no diminution in the
plague yet, that we can discern. Two of the
men we had helping to take Major T&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s
things from the water are attacked; one of them
is the fourth from a house, consisting of six.
The remaining servant of Mr. T&mdash;&mdash; had intelligence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
brought while I was there, that his aunt
was dead, which, he says, is the eighth near relation
he has lost.</p>

<p>Some of the Mohammedans, our neighbours,
were sitting under our windows last evening,
and were observing, that while two or three had
been taken from every house, we only had remained
free. And this is of the Lord&#8217;s marvellous
love. We consist of thirteen, including
the schoolmaster&#8217;s family, and the Lord has given
his destroying angel charge to pass over our
door.</p>

<p>The Pasha has sent to desire, that he might
have Major T&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s yacht drawn up near the Seroy
or Palace to go into, in case the water should
increase; and when the man was sent for, who
had the charge of the vessel, he with another
had run away, three were dead, and only one
remained. These are surely the days of visitation
for the pride of Edom. The man who sold
cotton for burying the dead, the price of which
he raised from 45 to 95 piastres, and who lived
only two doors from us, died yesterday. There
is no more cotton left in the city, and they now
bury the dead in their clothes. The price of
soap is raised four times higher than usual. I
have been enabled, by the Lord&#8217;s goodness, to
get all our water-jars filled, though at twenty
times the usual price. The bodies of persons of
considerable wealth are now just put on the back
of a donkey, or a mule, and carried away to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
buried, accompanied by one servant. We have
also much anxiety about the people of the
Damascus-caravan, of which we can hear no tidings,
whether or not they have been swallowed up by
the inundation. Whether they have been able
to retreat to some eminence, or what is become
of them we know not. The poor women who
have taken charge of the two poor little infants
have sent to us for food for them, as in these
countries they have no idea of bringing up children
by hand. It may be to be instrumental in
saving some of these poor little infants, and in
helping the orphans that remain, that the Lord
has allowed us to stay here. They are all Mohammedan
children.</p>

<p><em>April 26.</em>&mdash;For many days we have been unable
to obtain any account of the number of deaths;
but the <em>Chaoush</em> of Major T&mdash;&mdash; has been with
the Pasha this morning, who is in the greatest
possible state of alarm, wishing to go, but not
knowing how. One of his officers, whose business
it is to inquire about the number of deaths
daily, reported that it had reached 5,000, but
yesterday was 3,000, and to-day less. Enormous
as the mortality has been, I cannot but think
this beyond the truth; yet it must be remembered,
that the inundation kept immense masses
of poor thronged together in the city, who, but
for this, would have all fled in one direction or
another.</p>

<p>The accounts are heart-rending of little children
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
left in the streets; five were left yesterday, a
poor woman told us, near the Residency, and
others in different directions. If the wrath of
God is pouring out on the mystical Babylon,
as it is on this province of the literal Babylon;
the two antichrists are beginning to draw near
their end. But for the presence of the Lord
in our dwelling, as its light and joy, what a place
would this be to be alone in now; but with Him,
even this is better than the garden of Eden.
These are invaluable situations for the experience
of God&#8217;s loving distinguishing care, and here we
realize our pilgrim state much better than in the
quiet of England, with all its external apparent
security.</p>

<p>The utmost number of daily deaths I heard
of at Tabreez were 400, and here it is said to
be 4,000, and yet the population certainly is not
double. In going out to speak with a servant of
Major T&mdash;&mdash;, I saw a very decently dressed
female lying in a dying state of plague at our
door quite senseless; it is almost more than the
heart can bear. Yet, that the Lord will even
from these scenes prepare ways for the establishment
of his truth, I feel fully assured, and this
supports us. A north wind has regularly blown
for these four days past, so that we hope the
water will not again increase. Oh, may our
Father of his infinite mercy take away these
heavy heavy judgments, and make their present
measure instrumental to the advancement of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
kingdom. The Soochee Bashee, an officer of
police, has just been here, and tells us, that the
Pasha proposes removing to near Coote, a village
on the Tigris, half way between this and Bussorah.
At any other time, this would tend to most fearful
convulsions within the city; but in the present
state of things, perhaps, all may remain quiet,
without a governor. When the plague, that
now desolates the city ceases, we know not what
may happen; but this we do know, that the
love of our Father, and his gracious providence,
will be magnified by all events, and that we shall
yet praise him more and more. It seems to me
more than probable that the Pasha does not intend
to return. By the plague he has lost half
his soldiers, and a great number of his Georgian
slaves, who are his personal attached friends;
he may now remove without obstruction perhaps,
from any one, or the possibility of any communication
being made to his enemies to intercept
him; but time only will show; however this may
be, it is certain that should the plague cease
to-morrow, the city is in such a state, that no
resistance could be made for one moment to any
enemy. How invaluable the past proofs of the
Lord&#8217;s loving kindness and tender mercies are at
such times, the remembrance of him from the Hill
Mizar of the Hermonites. In going along the
streets to-day, I saw several poor sufferers labouring
under the plague; and a number of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
places, where clothes had been brought out and
burnt.</p>

<p>Our anxieties have been greatly increased by
the illness of our dear little baby; but our unerring
Physician has restored her to us to-day,
we trust in a measure which promises amendment.</p>

<p><em>April 27.</em>&mdash;To-day all thoughts are turned
from the plague to the inundation, which from
the falling of a portion of the city wall on the
north-west side last night, let the water in full
stream into the city. The Jews&#8217; quarter is inundated,
and 200 houses fell there last night: we
are hourly expecting to hear, that every part of
the city is overflowed. A part also of the wall
of the citadel is fallen. And, in fact, such is the
structure of the houses, that if the water remains
near the foundations long, the city must become
a mass of ruins. The mortar they use in building
is very like plaister of Paris, which sets
very hard, and does very well when all is dry;
but as soon as ever water is applied, it all crumbles
to powder; and in building walls of four or five
feet thick, they have only an outside casing of
brick work thus cemented, and within it is filled
up with dust and rubbish, so that what seems
strong enough in appearance to bear any thing,
soon moulders away, and by its own weight
accelerates its ruin. It must be many many
years, if ever, before the city can recover. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
it seems to me, that this seat of Mohammedan
glory, and of its proudest recollections, has received
its death-warrant from the hand of the
Lord. This inundation has not only ruined an
immense number of houses in the city, and been
the cause of tens of thousands dying of the plague,
but the whole harvest is destroyed. The barley,
which was just ready to be reaped, is utterly
gone, and every other kind of corn must likewise
be ruined, so that for 30 miles all round Bagdad,
not a grain of corn can be collected this year,
and perhaps, if all was quiet this might be of no
consequence, for from Mosul and Kourdistan it
might easily come; but this will be prevented by
the enemies of the Pasha who surround us.
The poor are beginning to feel immense difficulty
in the city, for all the shops are shut, and
there is a great scarcity of wood for firing; and
should the water now cause a general inundation
of the whole city, the heart sickens at the
contemplation of the scenes that must follow;
for the houses of the poor are nothing but
mud, scarcely one of which will be left standing.</p>

<p>For ourselves personally, the Lord has allowed
us great peace, and assured confidence in his loving
care, and in the truth of his promise, that our
bread and our water shall be sure; but certainly
nothing but the service of such a Lord as he is
would keep me in the scenes which these countries
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
do exhibit, and I feel assured will, till the
Lord has finished his judgments on them, for
the contempt of the name, nature, and offices of
the Son of God; yet I linger in the hope he has
a remnant even among them, for whose return
these convulsions are preparing the way.</p>

<p><em>April 28.</em>&mdash;News more and more disastrous.
The inundation has swept away 7,000 houses
from one end of the city to the other, burying
the sick, the dying, and the dead, with many of
those in health, in one common
grave.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Those who have escaped, have brought their goods
and the relics of their families, to the houses the
plague has desolated, or desertion left unoccupied,
and houses are yet falling in every direction.</p>

<p>The Lord has stopped the water just at the
top of our street by a little ledge of high ground,
so that as yet we are dry; and all free from the
sword of the destroying angel. Scarcity of provision
is beginning to be sensibly felt, so that
very respectable persons are coming to the door
to beg a little bread, or a little butter, or some
other simple necessary of life. To-day, the number
dying in the road was much greater than I
have before seen, and the number unburied in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the streets daily and hourly increases. The
Seroy of the Pasha is a heap of ruins, and though
he is most anxious to go, he cannot collect forty
men to man the yacht, for all fear of him is now
past, and love for him they have none; his distress
beggars all description, for not a single
native vessel is left in Bagdad, every one having
been employed in taking down the crowds to
Bussorah at the commencement of this dreadful
calamity. I have from day to day mentioned the
dead taken from the eight houses opposite to
ours; that number has to-day reached twenty-four;
in one of these, out of nine, one only survives;
and I mention twenty-four not as all, but
as those which have been seen carried out by
some of the schoolmaster&#8217;s family, who were however
very little in that room which overlooks this
passage. Of another family near the Meidan,
out of thirteen one only remains, and I have no
doubt there are hundreds of families similarly
swept away; yet amidst all these trials to the
servants of God, my heart does not despair for
the work of the Lord, for no ordinary judgments
seem necessary to break the pride and hatred of
this most proud and contemptuous people; but
the Lord will bring Edom down, and make a
way for the Kings of the East to his holy habitation.
We have taken one poor little Mohammedan
baby, about three or four years old, from the
streets, and are supplying a poor Armenian
woman with pap for another; but what is this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
among so many? We know not what to do. It
makes passing the streets most painful and affecting,
thus to see little children from a month or
six weeks, to two or four years, crying for a home,
hungry, and naked, and wretched, and knowing
not what to do, nor where to go. Thank God
however, to-day the water is a little abated, about
a span lower. Oh, may the Lord&#8217;s mercy spare
yet a little longer this wretched, wretched city.
Oh, how does the glory of the Chalifat lie in
ashes; she seems within a step of falling like her
elder sister Babylon, the glory of the Chaldean&#8217;s
excellency, and in how many things has her spirit
towards the church of God been as bad, yea
worse, than hers. Missionaries in these countries
have need of a very simple faith, which can
glory in God&#8217;s will being done, though all their
plans come to nothing. It was but the other day
we were surrounded by as interesting a school
of boys, and a commencing one of thirteen girls,
as the heart could desire; and now if the plague
and desolation were to terminate to-morrow, and
our scattered numbers were assembled, perhaps
not more than half would remain to us. Yet
dark as all the labours of the Lord&#8217;s servants in
these countries appears, I feel assured, that prophecy
points them out as specially connected with
many of the great events of the latter days.
Yet it requires great confidence in God&#8217;s love,
and much experience of it, for the soul to remain
in peace, stayed on him, in a land of such changes,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
without even one of our own nation near us,
without means of escape in any direction; surrounded
with the most desolating plague and
destructive flood, with scenes of misery forced
upon the attention which harrow up the feelings,
and to which you can administer no relief.
Even in this scene however, the Lord has kept
us of his infinite mercy, in personal quiet and
peace, trusting under the shadow of his Almighty
wing, and has enabled us daily to offer up to his
holy name praise, for suffering us to assemble
in undiminished numbers, when tens of thousands
have been falling around us. Neither is this
all, for he has made us know why we staid
in this place, and why we were never allowed
to feel it to be our path of duty to leave the
post we were in.</p>

<p><em>April 29.</em>&mdash;Our situation is becoming daily still
more extraordinary, and in many respects more
trying, except that our Lord is our hiding place,
who will preserve us from trouble, and will compass
us about with songs of deliverance. The
Pasha has fled, accompanied by his master of the
horse, and his immediate family. His palace is
left open, without a soul to take care of any thing.
His stud of beautiful Arab horses are running
about the streets, and are caught by those who
care to take the trouble, and offered for sale for
from &pound;10. to &pound;100. each; his stores also of corn
are left open, and every one takes what he wants,
or what he can carry away, which is a great relief
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
to the poor, for the quantities are enormous, in
expectation of a siege.</p>

<p>The plague is working its destructive way, apparently
with no other mitigation than that arising
from decreasing numbers in the city; the inundation
however, has prevented this having its full
weight, for it has thronged the remaining population
into a compass unnaturally disproportionate.
The house next us, which belongs to a Seyd, who
left it at the beginning of the plague, in charge
of two servants who are dead, is now filled by
twenty persons from different directions. The
unburied dead, and the dying, are fearfully accumulating
in the streets. So difficult it is now to
find persons to bury, that even the priest of the
Armenian church here, who died two days since,
remains yet unburied.</p>

<p>The water, thank God, is a little lower, but there
seems now every prospect that the moment the
waters decrease, the surrounding Arabs will come
in, and plunder the city; yet even this is in the
Lord&#8217;s hands&mdash;our wisdom has ever been to sit still,
and see the salvation of our God, and until we
see his cloudy pillar arise from off our tabernacle,
where we feel it has hitherto rested, and move
forward, we shall yet judge our safety to be to sit
still. We have in several instances seen, that
there was reason to bless God for remaining quiet.
We once thought of removing to the Residency, as
a change to the dear children, and as being nearer
to the water; but still on the whole we felt it best to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
remain here; and had we gone, we should have been
in the midst of the plague; or had we gone, when
the T&mdash;&mdash;s went to Bussorah, what a state should
we now be in, without the possibility of removing,
and in danger of our lives from the inundation
and falling of the walls, if we stayed.</p>

<p>We had again considered, whether it would be
right to leave this with the caravan for Damascus
and Aleppo, which seemed the only opening
there might possibly be for us, so that if we let
that pass by, we must stay whether we would or
not; still the Lord made us feel it was our path
to stay looking to him. And had we gone, what a
state should we have been in? For nearly three
weeks they have been surrounded with water,
continually increasing around them, so that now
we know not what their situation may be, whether
they are swept away, or remain; but at all events
we bless God for having inclined our minds to
stay. Why we did not join our dear and kind
friends the T&mdash;&mdash;s, in going to Bussorah, we do
not yet so clearly see the reason of, because we
have received no accounts thence, but it would
have cut up alike our connection with our work
here, and with our dear friends at Aleppo, with
whom we feel it daily of more and more importance
to have as speedy a meeting as possible for
advice and counsel.</p>

<p>We have just heard of the caravan already
mentioned, as going to Damascus and Aleppo.
The plague has taken off eight of the Armenians,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
and four have been drowned. The head of the
caravan is dead of the plague also, besides many
others; they must therefore return to Bagdad,
instead of advancing on their journey; so in this
instance at least we see great reason to bless God
for keeping us back. Yea, the Lord will instruct
us and teach us the way in which we should go,
and will guide us with his eye; this is our confidence
and comfort; and in such a time as this of
unheard of perplexity, what a source of abiding
peace is this. We feel it well to know our God
in such circumstances as ours. Among the Armenians,
thirteen died to-day, the largest number yet
in one day.</p>

<p><em>April 30.</em>&mdash;The report of the flight of the
Pasha, it appears was not true, and arose from the
two circumstances I have mentioned, of his horses
having been seen running about the streets, and his
supplies being open to the people. He has been
for several days endeavouring to get away, and
had drawn up for that purpose some boats under
the Seroy. All his stables were levelled to the
ground, and the place flooded with water. When
the distress of the people was mentioned to him,
he ordered one of his corn stores to be opened to
them. However, to-day, blessed be God&#8217;s Holy
Name, <em>the waters have sunk more than a yard</em>,
so we trust the great danger is over.</p>

<p>To-day, one more was brought out dead from
the eight opposite houses, making twenty-five, and
we know there are four more lying ill there. Our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
poor schoolmaster, who went in the caravan, is
dead, and was buried in his tent.</p>

<p><em>May 1.</em>&mdash;The Lord has brought us all in safety
to the beginning of another month, through the
most trying period of my life; yet the Lord has
every day filled our mouth with praise, and enabled
us to see his preserving hand.</p>

<p>To-day, as I passed along the street, I saw
numbers of dead bodies lying unburied, and the
dogs eating with avidity the loathsome food. Oh!
it made my very heart sink. The numbers of the
dead can now be no longer ascertained, for most
of the bodies are buried either in the houses or in
the roads; yet amidst all this, the Lord suffers not
the destroying angel to enter our dwelling; but
we feel the Lord has commanded the man with
the ink-horn to write us down to be spared, as this
is one of the vials of God&#8217;s wrath on his enemies.</p>

<p><em>May 2.</em>&mdash;We have heard nothing to-day to vary
the general scene of our calamities; the intensity
of this most desolating disease surpasses all
thought. Numbers of families are altogether
swept away; in numerous others, out of ten or
twelve, only one, two, or three remain; but I hear
of none, save our own, where death has not entered.
Yet, while I bless and praise the Holy
Name of our Lord, under whose wing alone we
came here, and under whose wing alone we have
trusted, the things my eyes have seen, and my
ears heard, press upon my heart, and make me at
times very sad; neither can I chase them from my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
mind. I can only look forward for comfort to that
day, when the Lord himself will come to put an
end to this dispensation of desolation, and introduce
his own peace. Yea, come Lord Jesus,
come quickly.</p>

<p>We have just heard melancholy tidings of another
caravan, which endeavoured to escape into
Persia from the plague, but has been forced back
again by the Arabs, the floods, and the scarcity of
provisions, and besides numbers among them have
died daily of the plague, so still we can bless God
we did not leave our present position by this last
opportunity. Let us then again bless him for not
allowing us to make haste.</p>

<p><em>May 3.</em>&mdash;To-day we trust the Lord has a little
alleviated the virulence of the plague; many attacked
yesterday, and the day before, have been
rapidly recovering, and fewer deaths have taken
place to-day&mdash;a great deal so far as we can ascertain.
May God&#8217;s holy name be praised, who is
a hiding place from every storm. We had our
water jars filled again to-day, when many, even
of the rich, who have connections in every direction,
find the greatest difficulty. &ldquo;Your water
shall be sure.&rdquo; We who are alone, and without a
friend within hundreds of miles in any direction,
have been supplied by our Lord&#8217;s gracious ordering;
thus he puts a new song into our mouths,
even a song of thanksgiving. To-day all are well,
even our dear little baby is quite recovered.</p>

<p><em>May 4.</em>&mdash;The weather has for these two or three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
days past been beautifully fine, and clear, and hot,
by which our God seems to have mitigated the
symptoms of the plague. All accounts to-day are
encouraging; the number of new cases few, and
the number of those recovering many. Our eyes
have also been rejoiced by the sight of three or
four water-carriers passing again, after an interval
of ten days; many more people have also been
passing and repassing than before; so we trust
the Lord is now taking away this desolating judgment,
which, in less than two months, has carried
away more than half the population of this city;
for, allowing that it had been silently making its
deadly course three weeks before it was discovered,
it does not exceed eight weeks, and by far the
greatest portion of deaths have been within the
last four weeks.</p>

<p><em>May 5.</em>&mdash;In my journal yesterday, I mention
more than half the population as having been
swept away in the inconceivably short space of
two months, but every account I have received,
convinces me that this is within the number;
certainly not less than two thirds have been swept
away, and this seems to have arisen from a
complication of causes. At the time when the great
mass of the population would have fled, and thus
have thinned the city, the waters rose so high,
that they could move only with great difficulty;
they waited in the hopes of the water subsiding,
instead of which, it so increased, that those who
had left the town and could get back, were compelled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
to return; those who could not, were
driven to seek some high ground where they might
remain safe from the water, but in all cases they
were crowded together without the power of moving
their position.&mdash;Again, in the city, when by
the death of immense multitudes the population
became greatly thinned, the inundation of the
water laid more than half the town level with the
ground, and drove the remaining people to congregate
together wherever they could find a dry
place or an open house, so that often twenty or
thirty came to reside together in the same house,
as was the case next door to us; thus again the
deaths became awfully great. Inquire where you
will, the answer is, The city is desolate: around
the Pasha four Georgians alone remain alive out
of more than one hundred. The son of our Moolah,
who is dead, told me to-day, that in the quarter
where he lives, not one human being is left&mdash;they
are all dead. Out of about eighteen
servants and seapoys that Major T. left, fourteen
are dead, two have now the
plague,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
and two remain
well. Among the Armenians, more than
half are dead. An Armenian who was with us
to-day, tells us, there are not more than twenty-seven
men left in one hundred and thirty houses.
I, however, think that this is exaggerated.</p>

<p>At Hillah, the modern Babylon, (population
10,000), there is, Seyd Ibrahim told me to-day,
scarce a soul left, and the dogs and the wild beasts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
alone are there feeding on the dead bodies. This
Seyd Ibrahim is one of the surviving servants of
Major T.; and is the only one of a family of fourteen
who remains alive.&mdash;His four brothers, their
wives, his own wife, their children, and his own,
are all dead. If mystical Babylon is suffering, as
the seat of this Archbishopric of the literal Babylon,
the times are not far off when the river Euphrates
shall be dried up for the kings of the east
to pass over.</p>

<p>For digging a grave they ask a sum that equals
in England three pounds, in consequence of
which numbers have remained unburied about the
streets, so that the Pasha has been obliged to
engage men, paying them at the same rate for
each body they will throw into the river.</p>

<p>In all the villages the desolation seems as complete
as it is here. When day by day I rise and
see our numbers complete, and all in health, my
soul is indeed made to feel what cannot the Lord
do? though ten thousand shall fall at thy right
hand it shall not come nigh thee.&mdash;I do not
yet see what effect all this is likely to have on our
labours here&mdash;whether it will break down or build
up barriers; yet we expect it will break down, for
the Lord seems thus breaking to pieces the power
if not the pride of this haughty people. I have
been struck two or three times lately, in going
out, with the intense hatred that lurks at the bottom
of the hearts of this people against Christians;
my dress manifested me to be one, and some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
Arabs I met, particularly the women, cursed me
with the most savage ferocity as I passed, two or
three calling out at me as though I were the cause
of all their calamities; and the people who are come
to live next door to us, are bitter against us, especially
one man among them, who seems to have his
heart quite corroded, because they are dying and
we are preserved by our Lord&#8217;s love; he sits and
talks under our window, saying, &ldquo;These Christians
and Jews alone remain, but in the whole of
Bagdad you will hardly find one hundred Mohammedans.&rdquo;
This is altogether false, for though
in proportion as many Christians may not have
died as Mohammedans and Jews, yet the deaths
among them have been enormous, as the preceding
accounts will have shewn.</p>

<p>Medicine I have found of no use. If you attack
the fever, they die of prostration of strength;
if you endeavour to support the constitution, they
die of oppression on the brain. Those cases
which first affected the head with delirium, have
been the most fatal; next those with carbuncles,
which did not appear, however, for a fortnight
after the commencement of the disease. Among
those who have recovered, almost the whole have
had large glandular swellings, speedily separating
and thus relieving the constitution.</p>

<p>This night, the first time for three weeks, I
have heard again the Muezzin&#8217;s call to prayers,
from the minarets of the Mosques.</p>

<p><em>May 6.</em>&mdash;The water to-day is much decreased.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
I saw a man also with fresh meat in his hand. I
likewise saw many recovering from the plague
walking about, leaning on sticks, and sitting by
the way-side. The number of deaths, among the
Armenians, to-day, amounted to 11, which, considering
that their whole remaining numbers cannot
exceed 300 at present, is an enormous mortality,
and has a little damped our hopes of a
speedy conclusion to this awful visitation.</p>

<p><em>May 7.</em>&mdash;Of the plague nothing satisfactory to-day.
Thieves are multiplying in every direction;
and news has come from Mosul that a new Pasha
has arrived there, who only waited for the cessation
of the plague to advance against Bagdad.
Great part of his work of destruction is already
done for him, as hardly a Georgian is left, and he
will find money enough left without owners, to
supply his own utmost rapacity, or the demands
of the Sultan. The Lord is our only secure resting
place, and we know that he who delivers us
out of six troubles, can and will deliver us out of
seven.</p>

<p>The water is decreasing most rapidly, so that
rice is beginning to be brought from the other side
of the river; and as all those who monopolized the
sale of wood, and not only asked enormous prices,
but cheated in the weight, are all dead, every one
now that needs wood takes it, so that the situation
of the poor seems in this respect a little improved.</p>

<p>There has not been among all the circumstances
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
of this scene of complicated suffering, any one
that has more painfully affected my own mind
than the increasing number of infants and little
children that have been left exposed in the streets,
and the absolute impossibility of meeting such a
state of things. We greatly desired to take one
or two; but our own little baby was ill, so that by
night Mary had hardly any rest, and at best, not
being strong in such a climate, we came reluctantly
to the decision that we were not able to
undertake such an additional charge.</p>

<p>This is an anxious evening. Dear Mary is
taken ill&mdash;nothing that would at any other time
alarm me, but now very little creates anxiety; yet
her heart is reposing on her Lord with perfect
peace, and waiting his will. A few hours, perhaps,
may show us that it is but a little trial of
our faith to draw us nearer the fountain of our
life. To nature it seems fearful to think of the
plague entering our dwelling; in our present
situation, nothing but the Lord&#8217;s especial love
could sustain the soul in the contemplation of a
young family, left in such a land, at such a time,
and in such circumstances; but we feel we came
out under the shadow of the Almighty&#8217;s wing,
and we know that his pavilion will be our sanctuary,
let his gracious providence prescribe what it
may. On his love, therefore, we cast ourselves
with all our personal interests.</p>

<p><em>May 8.</em>&mdash;The Lord has this day manifested that
the attack of my dear dear wife, is the plague, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
of a very dangerous and malignant kind, so that
our hearts are prostrate in the Lord&#8217;s hand. As
I think the infection can have only come through
me, I have little hope of escaping, unless by the
Lord&#8217;s special intervention. It is indeed an awful
moment, the prospect of having a little family
in such a country at such a time. Yet, my dearest
wife&#8217;s faith triumphs over these circumstances,
and as she sweetly said to me to day, &ldquo;The difference
between a child of God and the worldling is
not in death, but in the hope the one has in Jesus,
while the other is without hope and without God
in the world.&rdquo; She says, &ldquo;I marvel at the Lord&#8217;s
dealings, but not more than at my own peace in
such circumstances.&rdquo; She is now continually
sleeping, and when roused feels it difficult to
keep her dear mind fixed on any subject for a
minute. These are indeed the floods of deep
waters, but in the midst of them the Lord is
working his mysterious way, yet that way, however
bitter to nature, is for the everlasting consolation
of his chosen ones. She said to me, a few
minutes since, &ldquo;What does the Lord say concerning
me.&rdquo; I said, that you are a dear child of his.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;of that I have no doubt.&rdquo;
May the Lord of his infinite mercy sustain my
poor weak soul amidst these heavy visitations, that
at least we may magnify him, whether by life
or by death; what a relief it is now to my mind
to think that her&#8217;s was so much set against moving,
whenever I proposed it, and she often said in reply,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
&ldquo;The Lord has given me no desire nor sense
of the desirableness of moving, which I feel assured
he would have done had he seen it best.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>May 9.</em>&mdash;My dearest, dearest wife still alive,
and not apparently worse than yesterday. Oh! if
it were the Lord&#8217;s holy blessed will to spare her,
it would indeed rejoice my poor foolish heart, but
the Lord has enabled me to cast my wife, myself,
and my dear dear children on his holy love, and
to await the issue. Oh! what wrath there must
be against these lands, if not only the inhabitants
are swept away, but the Lord transplants also his
own, who would teach them, to his own garden of
peace. My soul has just been refreshed by these
two verses of Psalm 116. &ldquo;Return unto thy rest,
O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully
with thee. He has taken one of thy olive
branches to glory, and is now perhaps about to
take another, for precious in the sight of the Lord
is the death of his saints, for he only takes them
from the evil to come.&rdquo; Oh, but for Jesus, the
never setting star of our heavenly way, amidst
the wilderness what would our situation now be.
Jesus is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever,
and our heavenly Father&#8217;s love we have too often
proved to doubt it now. But, poor nature is
bowed very very low, when I look at my dear
boys and little babe, and see only poor little Kitto
to be left for their care for hundreds of miles
around; it needs all those consolations of God&#8217;s
spirit to keep the soul from sinking also with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
body; but the Lord has said, &ldquo;Leave your fatherless
children unto me,&rdquo; and to him we desire to
leave them.</p>

<p>We did feel assured that the Lord would spare
our dear little united happy family; but his ways
are not our ways, nor his thoughts our thoughts.
Dear little Kitto, I feel for his situation also from
my heart.</p>

<p>All the conversation of my dear dying wife, for
these twelve months past, but especially as our
difficulties and trials increased, was on the peace
she enjoyed in the Lord. Often and often she has
said to me, notwithstanding the disparity of every
thing external, I never in England enjoyed that sweet
sense of my Lord&#8217;s loving care that I have enjoyed
in Bagdad. And her assurance of her Lord&#8217;s love
never forsook her, even after she felt herself attacked
by the plague. While contemplating the
mysteriousness of the Providence, her mind was
overwhelmed; but when she thought on her Lord&#8217;s
love, she was confident in his graciousness. From
almost the first, her brain has been so oppressed,
that with difficulty she opens her eyes, and though
she can answer a question of two or three words,
Yes, or No; yet, if it involves the slightest exercise
of thought, she always replies, &ldquo;I do not
know what you say.&rdquo; When I consider all I
and the dear children lose, should we survive
her, it is almost more than my heart can contemplate.
On any essential point, for some years,
we have never had divided judgment on any material
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
point; in every work of faith, or labour of
love, her desire was to animate, not to hinder.
Such simple truth of purpose, and unaffected love,
and confidence in her Lord, as dwelt in her
dear departing spirit, I have seldom seen, and
those who knew her intimately will not think I
say too much. She has been to me in the relation
of Christian wife, and Missionary wife, just what
I felt I so much, so very much needed. And yet
the Lord sees fit to take her to himself, and add
one more from my little family to the chosen, faithful,
and true company that surrounds his throne.
Lord, then, though it cuts nature to the quick,
makes me feel its deepest suffering, and meets
me under the most complicated forms of trial,
yet if it be for thy glory, and her glory, do, dear
Lord, thine Almighty will, and we know thou
wilt to thy chosen, make light spring up out of
darkness.</p>

<p><em>May 10.</em>&mdash;Last evening my dearest wife was
more herself than she had been, till within a few
hours of her being taken ill, which was manifested
by her asking to see dear little baby, the first
thing she had voluntarily asked for, since her illness,
without being spoken to. She again mentioned
the subject of her confidence in her Lord,
and acquiescence in his will. She asked me
what I thought of her situation. I said I had
committed her to the Lord, who, I knew, would
deal graciously by her. She replied, &ldquo;Yes, that
he will.&rdquo; She continued in this state of improvement
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
till to-day at about nine o&#8217;clock, when her
mind again began to wander. When I quoted to
her, that to the Lord&#8217;s servants light should spring
up in darkness, she said, &ldquo;Yes, that it shall.&rdquo;
She said, &ldquo;I feel much better than yesterday&mdash;don&#8217;t
you see that I am.&rdquo; In fact, my hopes of
her being really improving would have been complete,
but from that peculiar look of the eyes,
which authors who have written on this subject,
all denote as most fatal; from this, therefore, my
hopes never were very high, yet though I had
yesterday been enabled, through the Lord&#8217;s grace,
to lie in his hands like a weaned child, to-day the
disappointment of the dear hope, slight as it was,
of having her restored to us, has brought my soul
again into very deep waters. She also this morning
expressed her anxiety about the dear children,
and her fear, least in attending her, I should take
the plague, and they be left orphans here.</p>

<p>In every respect, certainly the Lord has been
most gracious to her. She is about to be transplanted
to her native soil, where tears and sorrows
shall never enter, and in the way of her removal,
since the Lord&#8217;s time is come, nothing can be more
compassionate to her peculiar weakness of heart
than not allowing her anxiety to dwell on the dear
children, and their probable situation here. To
have been happy in quitting them, amidst such a
scene as now surrounds us, and in such a country,
perhaps no mortal faith could have been equal to;
the Lord, therefore, suffered not her mind to possess
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
its usual sensibilities; but took them from
her, and left her only to return to his bosom in
peace.</p>

<p>I feel the Holy Ghost again sustaining my poor
weak heart in the prospect of losing such a wife,
and remaining solitary here with three dear motherless
children; but I know the Lord in whom
I have believed, and he will not fail his chosen
in one of all those good things he has promised.
Our trials are indeed very very great; but the
Lord, the comforter, is greater even than they.
My dearest wife now (two o&#8217;clock,) is quite delirious.
Dear spirit! I have attended her night
and day since the evening of the 7th, on which she
was taken ill, and I allow no one else to approach
her. The Lord is my only stay, my only support,
and he is a support indeed.</p>

<p><em>May 11.</em>&mdash;This night has been the most trying
of my life. How hard for the soul to see the object
of its longest and best grounded earthly affections
suffering without the power of affording
relief, knowing too that a heavenly Father who
has sent it, can relieve it, and yet seems to turn
a deaf ear to one&#8217;s cries; at the same time, I
felt, in the depths of my soul&#8217;s affections, that
notwithstanding all, he is a God of infinite love.
Satan has sorely tried me, but the Lord has shewn
me, in the 22d Psalm, a more wonderful cry <em>apparently</em>
unheeded, and the Holy Ghost has given
me the victory, and enabled me to acquiesce in my
Father&#8217;s will, though I now see not the end of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
holy and blessed ways. Dear, dear spirit! she
will soon wing her way to where her heart has
long been; and, if I am spared, I shall perhaps
have reason to bless God for having removed her
thus early.</p>

<p>The plague has attacked two more of our household&mdash;the
schoolmaster&#8217;s wife and our maid-servant,
and how far it will go now, no one knows
but he who guides it by his sovereign will. My
dearest Mary&#8217;s sufferings for four or five hours
last night were great; she was quite delirious,
and her dear voice was so affected, that I could
not make out two words connectedly. How mysterious
are God&#8217;s ways! Oh my soul, learn the
lesson of patient submission to his holy will. I
have cast myself upon him and he will guide me.
Dear Mary, to-day has been quite insensible.
It has indeed been a very painful day, but it is the
condition of this world.  Dear spirit! her heart
has been so set on her Lord&#8217;s coming of late, that
it seemed quite to absorb her thoughts and heart.
And now she will quickly join the holy assembly
that are waiting to come with him. Surely such
times as these, when the Lord is taking a ripe
shock of corn from your field, are seasons to rejoice
that your prayer for the quick accomplishment
of the number of God&#8217;s elect has been heard,
and yet how hard it is for nature not to feel deep
sorrow that a message has come for one of yours.</p>

<p>Poor dear Kitto and the little boys are now
become the sole nurses of the dear baby by night
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
and by day. Oh, may the Lord watch over them
and bless them. My last night&#8217;s attendance on
my dear wife, leaves me little hope of escaping
the plague, unless it be our Father&#8217;s special will
to preserve me, for in her delirium she required
so many times to be lifted from place to place,
and to have all her clothes changed, that I can
now only cry to the Lord to preserve me, if it may
be a little while, for the dear children&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p>The Lord has most graciously provided us with a
servant of Mrs. T&#8217;s. to come and attend my dear

Oh may my soul bless him for this timely
help, just when our own servant was taken ill.
This woman has been in the midst of all the contagion,
and has never taken it; so it may be the
Lord&#8217;s will to shew how he can work even in the
midst of the darkest trials. She sits down beside
the dear sufferer, keeps the flies from her face,
and does every thing for her the fondest heart
could desire. She came out with us from England,
having gone there with Mrs. T.; is a native
of these countries, knows all that is required in
sickness, and how to perform the duties of a nurse,
with the most unwearied patience, tenderness,
and watchfulness. She also knows something of
English, and having been with dear Mrs. T. in
England, is acquainted with English customs.
Surely the Lord heard my cry in the day of my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
deep distress, for such a person perhaps could not
be got again within a thousand miles. That she
should have been left too when all the rest went
away. She has made dear Mary look so comfortable;
she washes her and changes her, who though
insensible, lies so quiet, and looks so composed.
She said she knew the Lord would be very gracious,
and he has been so indeed&mdash;he sees it right
to take his sheep home to his fold; but he has so
overwhelmed me by this proof of his loving kindness,
this ray of light arising in the midst of my
darkness, that it seems to have led my heart yet
more and more to love him and to confide in him,
that he may yet stay his rough wind in the day of
his east wind. This kind friend, Mrs. T.&#8217;s servant,
proposes to remain with us until all our family
are either well or dead.</p>

<p><em>May 12.</em>&mdash;Up to this day I am well, thank God,
but seeing the ways of the Lord are so marvellous,
I have arranged all my little concerns, and
put them into the hands of dear Kitto, for the
little boys and our dear little baby, till they arrive
at some of those places where there may be some
one to take care of them, and carry them to their
guardians or my trustees. But as poor Kitto is
so little able to provide even for himself, much
less for the little boys, I shall now endeavour,
the Lord enabling me, to arrange with this woman,
Mariam by name, to undertake every thing
for them till she can give them over to Major T.,
to whose family she is going, unless they return
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
here. This woman was an old servant of dear
Mrs. R. She has consented to undertake this
charge, and is to remain with the dear, dear children.
She knows enough of English to make
herself understood by the dear children, and she
thoroughly understands the language, manners,
and habits of this people.&mdash;Whether it may ever
be the Lord&#8217;s will to call into exercise the arrangements
of this plan or not, I trust I never shall
forget the Lord&#8217;s unspeakable mercy in shewing me,
that when I saw no earthly protector for my poor
children, his holy, loving, and fatherly hand
could provide one if it were necessary. Oh, may
my faith in him in the darkest day never fail, for
it is a light that springeth up in darkness.</p>

<p>Dearest Mary is gradually sinking into the
bosom of the Lord, and to join in the society her
soul has so long and so truly loved, of the lovers
of the Lamb of God. Though the Lord has
taken away the desire of my eyes, as it were
with a stroke, and left me a few hours to cry
unto him in the midst of my deep, deep waters;
yet these visions of his love have so revived my
soul, that my whole soul is brought to acquiesce
in his holy and fatherly arrangements, with respect
to her who was once the joy, the help, and companion
of all in which I was engaged. I sit
down now to wait, and see the salvation of my
God, for doubtless he will reveal, in his own
good time, the reason why he has acted so contrary,
not only to mine, but especially my dear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
wife&#8217;s strongest convictions, which were, that he
would preserve us all safe through this calamity.</p>

<p>When I now contemplate the spiritual state
of dear Mary&#8217;s mind for the last twelve months,
I am not at all surprised that the Lord has taken
her as a ripe shock of corn, but my expectation
while watching her spiritual progress was so
different. I saw her daily growing in the simple
assurance of her Lord&#8217;s love, and desiring under
heaven neither to know nor serve any other
than him. Her heart was panting for the Lord&#8217;s
coming, that the mystery of iniquity might be
finished, and the mystery of godliness be fully
established; but I thought not of all this being
preparatory to her joining her Lord, but for the
strengthening of my poor weak hands here. It
never entered my heart that I was to be left
alone, as far as earth is concerned, most alone.
Those friends for whom this journal is alone
designed, know how much she was to me, and
how deservedly so: this, however, the Lord saw
had its great, great dangers too, and may in his
infinite mercy to us both have ripened her so
rapidly for glory, and left me here to serve and
praise; for I have felt it was very, very hard to
be as the Apostle says, having a wife as though
I had none. Now, when I go and look upon her
having reached within one short step, the habitation
of all her hopes; I have not a spiritual
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
affection within my soul that would call her back;
but poor nature bows reluctantly its head.</p>

<p>The dear little baby also is but poorly. Her
dear little cry of mamma, mamma, cuts my poor
heart like a knife, to think, that from to-day or
probably to-morrow, she must cease to know that
endearing name, and such a mother too! However,
the Lord tells his children to leave their
fatherless, and doubtless motherless ones to him.
Lord, I desire so to do; for he is a dear and
kind father, though <em>nature</em> cannot always see it,
and indeed how could this be? for that which is
<em>natural</em> in us is, not only in its will opposed to
God, but even in its best affections tainted from
the fall. Were it not that the Lord whom we love
and serve, is as infinite in his compassions, as he
is mysterious in his ways, the days that must come
when the excitement of present suffering will be
past, and my soul begins to look round and see
the extent of its desolations, in a country, too,
where there is nothing to comfort or cheer me,
would appear to me too dark to be borne, did I
not know the Lord hath said, I will not leave you
orphans, but I will come unto you; so if he does
come and dwell more sensibly within me, even my
poor dull and slow-growing spirit may soon be
ripened and gathered into his kingdom, there to
join my dear departing spirit in the realms of
light.</p>

<p><em>May 13.</em>&mdash;My dearest wife has reached the light
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
of another day, still quietly sinking without a
sigh and without a groan. This my prayer for her
in the night of my darkness the Lord has mercifully
heard. At present all the remaining ones
of the family are well. I have separated the dear
little boys and Kitto, and allow them to hold
intercourse with none. The dear baby, and myself,
and the maid, and the little boy of our sick
servant, are also much separated, and this nurse,
whom the Lord sent us, alone attends the sick;
but yet so contagious is this fearful disease, that
when it has once entered your dwelling, you can
know no other safety than in your Lord&#8217;s preserving
care. These are indeed days of trial, but
doubtless they will have their precious fruit in all
God&#8217;s children; for the eyes of the Lord are upon
the righteous, and his ears are open unto their
cry&mdash;for the Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants,
therefore none of them that trust in him
shall be desolate&mdash;no, not even I, poor and worthless
as I am, I shall yet praise him who is the
Lord of my life, and my God.</p>

<p>The dear boys also keep up their spirits much
better than the first two or three days after their
dear mamma was taken ill. The magnitude of
present danger to themselves, and to all, in some
measure divides their thoughts, and prevents them
from resting alone on that deeply affecting prospect
before them, for they loved her most truly,
and, Oh! how much reason had they to love her.</p>

<p>I have just heard that the streets begin again
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
to be crowded, shops here and there to be opened,
and the gardeners are bringing things from without
into the city. To think that so near the end
we should have been thus visited, how mysterious!
Yet my soul says, What thou seest not, thou shalt
see. If it does but lead to my Lord&#8217;s glory, I am
sure it will lead to my dear sufferer&#8217;s; then why
should I repine?</p>

<p>Water is also reduced to 1s. 3d. the skin, the
price it was at before. For these proofs of mercy
to the people, we will bless God in the midst of
our own personal sorrows.</p>

<p><em>May 14.</em>&mdash;This day dearest Mary&#8217;s ransomed
spirit took its seat among those dressed in white,
and her body was consigned to the earth that gave
it birth&mdash;a dark, heavy day to poor nature, but
still the Lord was the light and stay of it.</p>

<p>I cannot help exceedingly blessing my heavenly
Father, however these calamities (for to nature
they are such, though not to the heirs of glory)
may end that he has allowed me to continue in
health so long as to see every thing done I could
have desired, and so infinitely more than I could
have expected, for her whom I have so much
reason to love.</p>

<p><em>May 15, 16.</em>&mdash;I have heard to-day that the
French Roman Catholic Archbishop of Babylon
has been dead a long time, and two of his priests,
and the remaining two fled. The poor schoolmaster&#8217;s
wife is dying, and our servant I trust,
recovering: the rest of our household within and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
without, thank God, all continue in good health&mdash;even
dear little baby, though rather cross from
want of amusement, and from her teeth.</p>

<p>They say new cases of plague have almost entirely
disappeared; may the Lord grant its speedy
disappearance altogether. We have had no intelligence
from the Taylors since their departure,
which makes us very anxious. As the waters are
decreasing, the relics of those families which fled
are returning; and, in numberless cases, out of
eighteen in a family who left, only one or two
return. The others died in the greatest misery
and destitution of all things, distressed by the
plague, the water, and scarcity, and the air in all
the roads was tainted from the immense number
of dead bodies lying by the way.</p>

<p>I feel to-day many symptoms similar to those
with which my dearest Mary&#8217;s illness commenced&mdash;pains
in the head and heaviness, pains in the
back, and shooting pains through the glands and
the arms. At another time I should think only
of them as the result of a common cold; but now
I know not how to discriminate, the beginnings
are so similar. Should these be my last lines in
this journal, I desire to ascribe all praise to the
sovereign grace and unspeakable love of my heavenly
Father, who, from before the foundation of
the world, set his eye of redeeming love on me in
the person of his dear and well-beloved Son. I
bless God for all the way he has led me; and vile
and wretched sinner as I feel I am, unworthily as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
I have in all my life served him, yet I feel he has
translated the affections of my inmost soul from
earth to heaven, from the creature to himself. As
to the dear, dear helpless children, I have committed
them to his love, with the full assurance
that if he transplants me from hence to himself,
to join the partner of my earthly history, he will
provide them much, yea, very much better than I,
or ten thousand fathers could do. To his love and
promises, then, in Christ Jesus, I leave them;
and strange and wonderful as his dealings appear,
he has made my soul to acquiesce in them. To all
the family of the redeemed of the Lord, especially
those I know, I entreat you let your conversation
be as it becometh the gospel of Christ; always
abound in his most holy work, for you know your
labour is not in vain in the Lord. Be as those who
wait for their Lord with your lamp trimmed, for
shortly he who shall come will come, and will not
tarry. My soul embraces those I especially knew
with all its powers, and desires for them that
Christ may exceedingly be glorified in them, and
by them, amen, and amen.</p>

<p><em>May 17.</em>&mdash;To-day the fever has almost entirely
left me, so that I feel a very little, except weakness,
but never can I sufficiently praise God for the experience
of yesterday. I certainly never expected
again to have written in this journal, and few circumstances
could have apparently presented themselves
more trying to the heart, to have the prospect
of soon leaving in a city like Bagdad, at this time,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
three helpless children, and the impossibility of
making those provisions for them, which at another
time might have been comparatively easy, seemed
altogether more than the heart could support; yet
so abundantly did the Lord allow his love to pass
before me, so fully did he assure me of his loving
care, that I felt no doubt for them&mdash;and, for myself,
the prospect of soon joining him was specially
exhilarating. He allowed me to see my free
and full forgiveness and acceptance, and I never
felt more the preciousness of such a salvation as
the Gospel of Jesus provides for the sinner, than
when I was as I thought, just entering eternity,
to plead it as the ground of my hope before God.
There seemed such simplicity in having only to
believe you were redeemed by his love, and should
be eternally preserved by the same, instead of
having to do with weighing the sum of your beggarly
services, all of which one hates now, and
oh, how shall we hate them when we see him face
to face. May our dear Lord make the promise
he made to his disciples, good to my poor bereaved
heart, and come himself and fill it with his fulness,
that having him I may indeed feel I have all
things.</p>

<p><em>May 18.</em>&mdash;Our poor servant died last night,
notwithstanding our hopes of her recovery, and
has left one little orphan boy of seven years old
with us. Oh that I could think of her transition
from hence to eternity, and contemplate her, as
the Lord to my unspeakable comfort allows me to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
contemplate my dear, dear wife, dwelling in the
light of her Lord&#8217;s countenance, where there is
fulness of joy for evermore.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster has just told me, that out of
forty relations, he has now only four&mdash;the rest have
all been swept away. The accounts we have of
the misery, in which many of these died who endeavoured
to fly, is truly heart-rending; with the
water nearly half a yard high in their tents, without
victuals or the means of seeking or buying
any, they suffered every privation and misery
that can be imagined, and one poor family which
has returned, described the intense desire they
had to return and die quietly in their houses. But
return they could not, for the waters had so risen
that there was no road, and no boats could be obtained,
but at an immense price, which a few only
could pay, and very few obtain even at any price.</p>

<p>Oh! how many alleviations to the trials of parting
with those we loved, the Lord allowed us in
permitting us to see them surrounded by every
comfort they could want, and with every attendance
that could alleviate a moment&#8217;s uneasiness.</p>

<p>From the Taylors at Bussorah we have yet
heard no accounts, and are therefore most anxious
to know how the Lord has been moving among
them. I have just heard that orders have
come from Stamboul,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
to the Pashas marching
against this Pasha, to desire them to return, and
that another messenger is on the way from Stamboul
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
to bring his annual dress of investiture. Should
it be really thus, our dear friends may soon be
here from Aleppo; it would indeed be a great
comfort; but the Lord regards, in this dispensation,
our real advantage more than our sensible
comfort, we therefore desire to leave all to his
Holy, gracious ordering, who, though he orders
all things after the counsel of his own free will,
has no will towards us, but that we should be
filled with the fulness of Christ, and be conformed
to his image.</p>

<p><em>May 19.</em>&mdash;The water to-day has again fallen
considerably in price, and as far as we can judge,
God has mercifully nearly extinguished this desolating
plague. I now feel quite satisfied the attack
I had the other day was an attack of the
plague, though very slight. The schoolmaster,
yesterday, was attacked in the same way with a
pain in his back and head, and a pain in his glands,
one of which is decidedly enlarged, but still it is
very slight, and I trust to-morrow, with the
Lord&#8217;s blessing, to see him, with the exception of
weakness, well again. We are, thank God, all
well; the only thing I now suffer from is weakness
and pain in the glands and under the arm,
but there is no enlargement, and I trust in a day
or two it will go entirely away. I heard, to-day,
the Pasha had been ill of the plague this week; it
is now reported he is dead; but we know nothing
certain. One of his sons is also dead.</p>

<p>This has been a heavy day with my poor heart,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
so slow a scholar am I under my dear Master&#8217;s
teaching. Yet I feel he will fill me with his own
most blessed presence, and then I shall be able to
bear easily all other bereavements. How strange
it is that feeling should rule with so much
more power than principle, over the happiness of
the soul, even when the spirit still imparts strength
to direct the conduct aright. The feelings seize
on the slightest recollection; and oh, what fuel
have they when every thing in the minutest daily
occurrences, every thing in the events passing
around us, at once come directly on the heart
and press upon it; and when there is not a soul
near, not only not to supply all that is lost, but
not even a portion of it, and yet notwithstanding
all this, that now weighs on me, I feel the Lord
himself will be yet more to me than all I have
lost. I feel I have been skimming too much on
the surface of Christianity instead of being clothed
with Christ. Oh! what a child am I in the life
of faith, but I feel the Lord has my poor soul in
his training, and though the discipline may seem
severe, it is only the severity of uncompromising
love.</p>

<p><em>May 20.</em>&mdash;This has been a day of mercies at
the hand of the Most High. For a day or two
past, I had observed a little dust falling through
a creak in the wall, and although on any other
occasion, it would have excited no anxiety; yet,
knowing the cellars were full of water, I thought
it better this morning early to take out all our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
things from this room; it was our own, mine and
dear Mary&#8217;s, and therefore contained all we had of
clothing, &amp;c.; the dear little boys and the servant
were helping me, and we had not finished
taking out the last things above ten minutes, when
the whole arch on which the room was built gave
way&mdash;our little stock of things and ourselves being
all safe. Oh! my soul, bless the Lord who watcheth
over the ways of his children.</p>

<p>Oh! how easy it is to kiss our dear and loving
Father&#8217;s hand when he turns bright providences
towards us. How easy, then, it is to praise! but
I feel my dearest teacher is teaching me the hardest
lesson to kiss the hand that wounds, to bless
the hand that pours out sorrow, and to submit,
with all my soul, though I see not a ray of light.
Oh, thou holy and blessed Spirit, come and help
thy poor wayward scholar, who indeed would not
entertain a hard thought of his dear and loving
Father. Through much tribulation we must enter
into the kingdom; therefore, blessed Lord, prepare
me for thy service. I am a poor inexperienced
soldier; clothe me with the whole armour
of God, that my soul may praise in the darkest
day. All but myself are quite well, and my indisposition
seems only at present a little weakness,
which perhaps the exertions of removing the things
from our room to-day, and all the painful associations
connected with it, has this evening a little
increased: but the Lord is very pitiful, and says,
Ask what you will of my Father, and he will give
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
it you. Dear Lord, fill me with thyself, that there
may be no more room for the grief of any creature.
Thou, and thy Father, and the blessed Spirit,
one eternal God alone, are eternally a satisfying
portion.</p>

<p>I am very anxious about the poor schoolmaster:
should he die, he will be the last of our teachers;
<em>three</em> are already dead, and he alone remains.&mdash;Oh,
my Lord, my soul desires to wait on thee for
light, and to remember Mizar and Hermon&mdash;days
when the sun shone upon our path; but the frost
may be as necessary to bring the cover to full perfection
as the genial sun and showers. Dear Husbandman,
do thine own will, only make us bear
much fruit, that thou mayest be glorified.</p>

<p><em>May 21.</em>&mdash;Last night thieves endeavoured three
times to force an outer door, but did not succeed&mdash;the
whole city is swarming with them.</p>

<p>To-day the Pasha of Mosul is come to Bagdad;
what it portends we know not; but the Lord
reigneth, therefore let the Saints rejoice; they
can only accomplish his will who is our Father
and our God.</p>

<p>I have to-day sent off a messenger to Major
T. to Bussorah, may he quickly return with good
tidings of them all. To-day I have also heard of
a caravan proposing to go to Aleppo. Every account
we have of the plague confirms its almost
entire disappearance. Our walking now is altogether
by faith: we see not a ray of light for the
future, but the Lord will let light spring out of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
darkness, so that his servants who wait upon him
shall not always mourn. Oh how different a thing
faith is in a cloudy and dark day, and when all
things smile around. I had intentionally renounced
the world, yet the Lord saw that I held
more of it than I knew in the dear object he has
removed. In England, where I had many dear
Christian friends, she was my constant companion;
but <em>here</em> she was on earth all I had left&mdash;my sorrows,
my hopes, my fears, she shared and bore
them all. I feel Christ my Lord has in store for
me in himself some great and special good in exchange
for all this, but my poor weak faithless
heart does not yet see the way of his going forth.</p>

<p>Miriam is most kind to my sweet little helpless
babe.</p>

<p><em>May 22.</em>&mdash;Our dear Lord said to his sorrowing
disciples, You have heard how I said unto you, I
go away and come again unto you. <em>If ye loved
me ye would rejoice because I said I go unto the
Father</em>, that is, if you loved me above the enjoyment
of my society and help, ye would rejoice;
how hard this is: as it was true of the departing
head, so it is true of every member, and yet I feel
my selfish heart constantly forgetting that true
love which under the crucifixion of all one&#8217;s own
feelings can truly rejoice at the happiness of an
object beloved, even at this expense.</p>

<p>This has again been an anxious day. Dear Henry
complained this morning of a swelling under his ear,
or rather under the angle of the jaw, where there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
was on feeling it, an evidently enlarged gland; however,
to the praise of the Lord&#8217;s great grace, it is
evidently passing away without any general attack
on the constitution. I really believe the Holy Ghost
is making these events instrumental in working a
deep sense on the minds of the dearest boys of the
importance of their souls; there is a concern about
religion, a willingness to talk about it I have
not before observed. Oh, may the Lord&#8217;s blessed
spirit water these seeds till they become plants of
renown, to the glory of our own Lord&#8217;s great
name.</p>

<p><em>May 23.</em>&mdash;Oh my poor heart flutters like a bird
when it contemplates the extent of its bereavement
as a husband, a father, a missionary. Oh,
what have I not lost! Dear Lord sustain my poor
weak faith. Thy gracious visits sometimes comfort
my soul; yet my days move heavily on; but the
Lord who redeemeth the souls of his servants has
declared, that none of those who trust in him shall
be desolate. Lord I believe, help thou mine unbelief.
I do indeed desire with my whole soul to
cast myself into the ocean of thy love, and never to
let Satan have one advantage over me, by instilling
into my heart hard thoughts of thy ways.
Surely we expect trials, and if so, and thou sendest
one other than we expected, should it surprise us
when we see but a point in the circle of thy providence,
and thou seest the end from the beginning.</p>

<p><em>May 24.</em>&mdash;To-day Kitto has been very unwell.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
<em>May 25.</em>&mdash;To-day the dear baby is very unwell,
but Kitto better. Thus the Lord interchanges
his merciful trials and merciful reliefs. I
feel one great want, &ldquo;To be filled with all the
fulness of Christ,&rdquo; that there may be no room for
those fluctuations, which from short intervals of
sweet peace, plunge me into depths of sorrow and
astonishment: yet I know the Lord will heal, he
will bind up what he has broken. O my soul,
wait patiently on him to learn all, I know he would
teach thee: let patience have her perfect work,
for the trial of our faith is much more precious
than of gold that perisheth. My eyes are daily,
hourly looking unto the Lord for a little ray of
light, but as yet I see none: yet we know that
they that trust on the Lord shall not walk in darkness,
but mercies shall encompass them about.</p>

<p><em>May 26.</em>&mdash;To-day, thank God, all our household
are tolerably well.&mdash;All accounts from without
say the plague is ended. May the Lord grant it!</p>

<p><em>May 27.</em>&mdash;My dear baby still very poorly.
Dear Lord, I commit this tender delicate flower to
thy loving gracious keeping. Oh my God, my
soul has been much cast down within me; but
thou hast enabled me to remember thee from the
land of Jordan, and the Hermonites, from the
hill Mizar. O Lord, only let thy love appear
shining through the clouds that surround me, and
my soul will rejoice; it is only when the adversary
prevails so far as to say, He loves thee not, that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
my soul is overwhelmed within me; for if I have
not the Lord, whom have I? for vile and worthless
as all my manifestations of love have been,
cold and dead as all my worship, low and doubting
as all my confidence has been, yet Lord, all
my desire is to love thee better and serve thee
more singally, who art infinitely worthy of all love
and all service. How strong our tower seems till
the Lord blow upon its foundations, and then
much that looked so fair, flies like the chaff of the
summer threshing floor, and meet it is, if the immoveable
parts of Christ&#8217;s own building be found
to connect the poor fluttering soul with the Rock
of Ages. Oh may my soul drink daily more and
more deeply into that spirit of adoption and love,
and assurance of the Lord&#8217;s favour, that gilded the
last year of my dear, dear Mary&#8217;s life.&mdash;Lord, I feel
I am a very child; but Lord, lead thou me by
thine own right hand. Oh my heart longs for
Christian communion&mdash;some one to whom I can
talk of Jesus and his ways, and with whom I may
take counsel; yet it now seems as though many
months must elapse before our dear friends can
come from Aleppo, but the Lord knows what
is best, and to him we leave all our cares, and the
providing for all our necessities. I pray the Lord
to pour down his Holy Spirit upon my poor heart,
and strengthen it for trials. It was one of my
dearest Mary&#8217;s greatest comforts, as it has been
mine, to know so many of those who were dear
to the Lord, and had purposed wholly to follow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
him, were praying for our guidance and welfare;&mdash;this
used to be in our evening walks, on the
roof of our house, a theme of thanksgiving, and
used daily to draw out our hearts to the Lord for
the continual dew of his blessing upon them. Oh
when they hear of all the Lord&#8217;s dealing, may their
spirits be stirred up within them to pray that I
may be filled with him who filleth all in all. I
long to love my Eternal God&mdash;Father, Son, and
Spirit, more with all my undivided heart; the
coldness of my love&mdash;the lowness of my desires is
my abiding sorrow.</p>

<p><em>May 28.</em>&mdash;To-day came letters from England,
but Oh, how strangely altered; those very letters
which would have animated anew all our endeavours,
and led us to praise God together, had
dearest Mary been here to share them, came
winged with passages that wrung my heart. But
still the love of the saints of God, of those we
love, has much sweetness in it; and then again to
hear of our dear sister&#8217;s thoughtful love towards
our tender little babe in providing her clothes,
which, while they are doing, my heart heaves
with the prospect of losing the sweet little flower&mdash;so
tender&mdash;so needing more than a mother&#8217;s care.
But the Lord is most compassionately gracious,
and what he does not reveal, he will hereafter.</p>

<p>I have also had intelligence to-day that my dear
brothers and sisters had been two months ago on
the point of setting off for Aleppo; but whether
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
they received news of the plague and returned,
or are waiting at Anah, I know not, but I greatly
need them&mdash;yet still the Lord knows best how
much I need them, and when.</p>

<p>When I think of my lowness in the attainments
of the divine life, my little knowledge, and
less love of my dear Lord, I wonder how he has
so graciously allowed me a place in the hearts of
his chosen, and that he should allow our weak,
tottering, and faithless walk, to encourage the
young and lusty eagles to take their higher flight
is wonderful; but it is that the glory might be
his.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>In concluding this portion of my journal, I shall
just take a little view of the last two years, as it
is now within a few days of two years since I left
my dear, dear friends and native shore.</p>

<p>From the day my dearest Mary and myself deliberately
prepared to set out on the work in which
we finally embarked, the Lord never allowed us
to doubt that it was <em>his</em> work, and that the result
on the church of God would be greater than our
remaining quietly at home. All our subsequent
intercourse with his dear children in England,
and in our journey, had a confirmatory tendency,
and all the communications from the dear circle
to whom we were known, insignificant as we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
were, convinced us that the cause of the Lord
had suffered no detriment&mdash;that many had been
led to act with more decision, and some to pursue
measures which possibly might not otherwise have
been undertaken.</p>

<p>Again, the Lord&#8217;s great care over us in his
abundant provision for all our necessities, although
every one of those sources failed we had calculated
upon naturally when we left England, enabled
us yet further to sing of his goodness.</p>

<p>Then, as to our work; when we left England,
schools entered not into our plan; but when we
arrived here, the Lord so completely put the school
of the Armenians into our hands, that on consultation
both my dearest Mary, myself, and Mr. Pfander
thought that the Lord&#8217;s children and saints must
take the work the Lord gives, particularly
as there appeared no immediate prospect of
other work. We entered on it, and by dear Mr.
Pfander&#8217;s most efficient help, the children were
soon brought to translate God&#8217;s word with understanding,
and the school increased from 35 to near
80. My dearest Mary had long desired to undertake
the girl&#8217;s school exclusively; but previous
to her confinement she did not feel able; but as
soon as she got about, she undertook it heartily,
and the dear little children were so attached to
their employments, that they used to come on
their holidays. She had got so far on in Armenian,
as to be able to prepare for them, in large
characters, some little pieces of Carus Wilson&#8217;s,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
which I got translated into the Armenian of this
place, and the dear little children were so interested
by them, that they exceedingly desired to
take them home, and read them to their mothers,
which in two or three days they were to have done.
For our own instruction in Arabic and Armenian,
and for the school, we had five most competent
teachers. Thus things went on up to the end of
March, when the appearance of the plague obliged
us to break up the school. But now two months
have passed, and Oh! how changed. Half the
children, or more, are dead; many have left the
place; the five teachers are dead, and my dear,
dear Mary. When I think on this, my heart is
overwhelmed within me, and I remain in absolute
darkness as to the meaning of my Lord and Father;
but shall I therefore doubt him now, after
so many proofs of love, because he acts inscrutably
to me? God forbid! That the Lord made the
coming of my dearest wife, and her multiplied
trials and blessings, the instruments of her soul&#8217;s
rapid preparation for his presence, I have no
doubt. I never heard a soul breathe a more simple,
firm, and unostentatious faith in God. She
never had a doubt but that it was for the Lord
she left all that was naturally dear to her to expose
herself to dangers from which, with a constitutional
timidity, she shrunk. Her soul was most
especially drawn out towards her Lord&#8217;s coming,
and this spread a gilded halo round every trial.
She constantly exclaimed, as we walked on the roof
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
of our house<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
of an evening, &ldquo;When will he come?&rdquo;
Often she would say to me, I never enjoyed such
spiritual peace as since I have been in Bagdad&mdash;such
an unvarying sense of nearness to Christ,
and assurance of his love and care; we came out
trusting only under his wing, and he will never
forsake us. Her strongest assurance was certainly
that the Lord would not allow the plague to enter
our dwelling; but when she saw that the Lord
mysteriously accepted not this confidence, but let
it rest even on her, it never disturbed her peace,
as I have mentioned before. She said to me, &ldquo;I
know not which is to me most mysterious, that the
Lord should have laid his hand upon me, or,
having laid it, that I should enjoy such peace as
I do.&rdquo; And in this peace and confidence, every
subsequent moment of sensibility was passed. Her
constant exclamation was, &ldquo;I know he will do
most graciously by me.&rdquo; Yet notwithstanding all
the happiness I have in contemplating her among
the redeemed, thus clothed in white; and
notwithstanding the triumphing conviction I have in
spite of the temptations of Satan, and the darkness
that envelopes my present position, that all
is the offspring of infinite love; yet at times the
overwhelming loss I have sustained, in every possible
way that a husband, a father, a missionary,
and even a man, can know, so affects me that but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
for my Lord&#8217;s loving presence, I should be overwhelmed.</p>

<p>I now wait till the arrival of my dear friends to
consult with them as to our future plans. May
the Lord, if it be his pleasure, quickly send them
hither, and direct us in all our plans and purposes,
so that we may be led to fulfil his will.</p>

<p><em>May 30.</em>&mdash;A messenger has arrived from Bussorah,
bringing intelligence of the kind Taylors;
but the letters he brought were all taken from
him, and he stripped to his shirt, a few miles from
Bagdad. However, by word of mouth, he brings,
on the whole, good accounts. All their immediate
family are well; some have died, among
those that accompanied them, and nearly all the
Arab sailors, but as the letters are lost, we know
not the particulars.</p>

<p><em>May 31.</em>&mdash;I have had another proof of my
heavenly Father&#8217;s care. An Armenian merchant has
sent his servant to me to say, he proposes sending
him every day to buy for me what I want from
the bazaar, and also to offer me any money I may
want. The latter I had no occasion to accept, for
when the Jew left the city who was to supply me,
and the man died who was to obtain it for me,
and I seemed left without remedy, an Armenian
offered to supply whatever I might want, without
any application on my part, and from him I have
had what I needed.</p>

<p>Whether or not the affairs of the Pasha are
likely to be quietly settled, I know not; but I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
think there are some indications that the present
Pasha will remain. So intensely ruined does the
city appear, that the Pasha of Aleppo, who was to
have come and dispossessed him, seems to have
no desire for the exchange; and besides, the present
Pasha has offered so large a sum of money,
that there appears little doubt it will be accepted.
Dispatches have arrived for him, the contents
of which are not yet known; but the Pasha
says, he has received the most satisfactory letters.
He is, I believe, recovering daily his strength.</p>

<p>Thus I finish this melancholy portion of my
journal&mdash;one of those dark pages in the history
of one&#8217;s life, that whenever the thoughts stray
towards it, chills to the very centre of one&#8217;s being;
and when we trace all its sources, and see they
terminate in sin, Oh! how hateful must that thing
be, which is fraught with such deadly consequences.
Oh! what a blessedness it is, amidst
all these lights and shades of life, to know that
the Rock on which we rest is the same, and does
not vary; and that whether he administers to us
the bitter portion or the sweet, his banner over us
is love.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p><em>June 5.</em>&mdash;Reports are again spreading that the
Pasha of Aleppo is within a few days of this place.
But we sit down and patiently wait the event.</p>

<p><em>June 7.</em>&mdash;To-day a letter has reached me from
Major Taylor, being the first I have received since
he removed his family from this place to Bussorah,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
on the breaking out of the plague here. In every
one of the boats going down the river deaths
occurred, but especially in theirs, they losing seven
of their party. The plague broke out among the
Arab sailors, who secreted a corpse in the boat
several days, and from them it spread among his
African servants, and seized Mrs. Taylor&#8217;s
brother-in-law, so that I cannot see my early
conclusions were wrong as to not moving at that
time. And, moreover, the Pasha, or rather
Motezellim of Bussorah, has been driven out by a
party of Arabs, and he is now come against the
town with another large body of Turks, to endeavour
to recover it; so that even this evil of the
sword we should not have escaped. The Lord,
therefore, leaves me nothing to regret, unless it
be that I ought perhaps to have kept myself quite
apart from the rest of the family, after I had been
obliged by a sense of duty to go out during the
time the plague was raging. It is easy to be wise
after the events are past. The more I contemplate
the circumstances in which I have of late
been placed, the more I see of the trials and
anxieties of the missionary life, and of the mysteriousness
of God&#8217;s dealings; I feel the more overwhelmed
with the importance of the soul having
a deep sense of the love of God in Christ,
before it ventures upon such an undertaking. Our
dear Father very often, in love, explains to us his
reasons; at other times, he gives no account of
his matters; in the one case to excite love and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
confidence, in the other, to exercise faith. It
does seem to me, that no doctrines but those of
the sovereign grace of God, and his love entertained
towards the soul, before the foundation of
the world, and the revelation by the Holy Ghost
of the love and fellowship with Christ, and through
him with the Father, so that we have thereby
our life hid with him where no evil can reach us,
can happily sustain the soul. There is something
so filthy, so worthless in all our services, when
events render it probable to the soul that soon it
will appear before God, that the new creature
cannot endure the deformity and defilement, and
turns away its distressed sight to the love of the
Lord, and the garment he has provided without
spot or wrinkle, or any such thing. The experience
of my dear dear Mary on this head was most
striking. She often said to me, &ldquo;They often
talked to me, and I often read of the happiness of
religion&mdash;but I can truly say I never knew what
misery was till I was concerned about religion, and
endeavoured to frame my life according to its
rules&mdash;the manifest powerless inadequacy of my
efforts to attain my standard, left me always
further removed from hope and peace than when
I never knew or thought of the likeness of Christ,
as a thing to be aimed after; and it was not till
the Holy Ghost was pleased of his infinite mercy
to reveal the love of my Heavenly Father in
Christ, as existing in <em>himself</em> before all ages,
contemplating me with pity, and purposing to save
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
me by his grace, and to conform me to the image
of Him whom my soul loves, that I really had
peace, or confidence, or strength. And if in any
measure I have been able to walk on with joy in
the ways of the Lord, it has been from the manifestation
of <em>his</em> love, and not from the abstract sense
of what is right, nor from the fear of punishment.&rdquo;
This was the theme of her daily praise&mdash;the love
and graciousness of her Lord; and I can set my
seal, though with a comparatively feeble impression,
to the same truths, that the sense of the love
of Christ is the high road to walk in according to
the law of Christ.</p>

<p><em>June 9.</em>&mdash;I have heard from a German merchant,
Mr. Swoboda, that above 15,000 persons,
many sick with the plague, and others, were buried
under the ruins of the houses that fell in the night
the water burst into the city. Nothing can give
a more awful impression of the mass of misery
then in the city, than that such an event, which at
another time, would have called forth every exertion
to remove the sufferers, and have been the
universal conversation and lamentation of the city,
passed by without any effort to relieve them,
and almost without a word of remark, but from
those immediately connected with the sufferers.
I hear that those who have closed their houses
intend opening them on the 18th inst. I bless
God for the intelligence; and trust the plague has
quite left us. Mr. Swoboda tells me he does not
expect to open his khan again for 12 months;&mdash;this,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
however, does not arise simply from the
plague, but because the rich merchants have all
left the city, and the principal Jews, from the
apprehension of the coming of Ali Pasha from
Aleppo, and that in consequence trade is at a
stand.</p>

<p><em>June 10.</em>&mdash;Last evening the guns of the citadel
fired as for some good news, and we find, on enquiring,
that a messenger has come from the Sultan,
confirming the Pasha in his
Pashalic.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
The Tartars, who are the bearers of this intelligence,
are expected to enter to-morrow or next day.
This arrangement, it is reported, has been brought
about by our Ambassador at Constantinople.&mdash;Should
it be the Lord&#8217;s pleasure that we now have
a little peace and quietness here, it will be a
great mercy, and an inconceivable relief from the
disquietude of the last 18 months; however, the
Lord knows what is best for us. These difficulties
have led my heart many times to him, when, perhaps,
but for them, it would have rested on some
lower object. This prospect of peace seems to
bring nearer the possibility of our dear friends
joining us from Aleppo, and this would indeed be
a great comfort.</p>

<p><em>June 11.</em>&mdash;This day has made manifest that
more judgments are coming upon the city, and
instead of a <em>Firman</em> in favour Daoud Pasha, bringing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
peace, we can hear the sound of the cannon
of the new Pasha. He will little regard the <em>Firman</em>
that has come from the Sultan, if it has really
come, and which being here universally believed
to have been procured through the instrumentality
of our Ambassador, places the English in no very
acceptable position; but the Lord is our tower,
yea, our high tower, and into <em>him</em> we run. The
enemy is now about six miles off, and the whole
city is in a state of commotion that cannot be
described, every one armed with swords, pistols, and
guns, preparing for the expected contest. O
Lord, we commend ourselves to thy holy keeping,
for thou neither slumberest nor sleepest. When
all the difficulties of these countries follow upon
one another as rapidly as they have of late done
here, it seems very difficult to see how the word
of life is to go forth as a testimony. Yet it will;
for the Lord hath said it; therefore let not our
hearts fail, or our hands hang down, for the
Lord of all circumstances, who governs the most
disastrous as well as the most prosperous, is our
own Lord, the only begotten of the Father, full
of grace and truth. All the bazaars are closed,
and we are taking in water again at an advanced
price. Oh! Lord, when will thy holy and blessed
kingdom of peace come, when the nations shall
learn war no more, but love and light shall flourish
in the Lord! Wherever the blasting influence of
Mohammedanism extends, how iron bound all appears
against the truth: yet even this the Lord
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
will soften by his love, or break by his power.
May my soul be daily more and more sensible of
their misery and pride. Poor Mr. Goodell says,
in a letter, that after all the labours the American
missionaries have bestowed in Syria, they scarcely
know an individual to whom their message has
been peace, saving in the case of two or three
Armenians of whom they hoped well. No one
can imagine the disheartening feelings that often
try the missionary&#8217;s heart in the countries where
Mohammedanism is professed and dominant, and
where your mouth is sealed. Among heathens,
and especially in India, you can publish your testimony,
and this is a great comfort to the heart
that knows what a testimony it is, and what
promises are connected with its publication.</p>

<p>Shortly after we ascended to the roof for our
evening walk, we heard the cannon and small
arms begin to fire, which informed us that the
contest was begun within the city. About eight
o&#8217;clock we heard multitudes crying out and shouting
before the seroy, or palace, and the account
was soon brought us that the inhabitants had
broken in and seized the Pasha. After this all
became quiet, except the firing of guns from the
tops of the houses, to frighten off the thieves, and
the cry of the watchmen, whom all, who can afford
it in these trying occasions, keep to protect them.
The Lord has hitherto extended his sheltering
wing over us, though without sword, pistol, gun,
or powder in the house; and the only men besides
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
myself, are Kitto, who is deaf, and the schoolmaster&#8217;s
father, who is blind: but the Lord is our
hope and our exceeding great reward.</p>

<p><em>June 12.</em> <em>Lord&#8217;s day.</em>&mdash;The wretched Pasha
has just passed our house under a guard to the
residence of Saleh Beg, almost the only male relation
he suffered to live of the family he supplanted.
The Lord is now visiting on him his
cruelty and blood; so that what with the plague
and now the sword, there will hardly be one of
the apostate Georgians left.</p>

<p>The day dawned quietly; but our house has
just been attacked by a band of lawless depredators,
asking for powder and offensive weapons. I
told them I had none; but seeing a carpenter
whom I knew, I told him I would let him and
three others in, if they would promise me that no
more should come in, which they did. So they entered,
and were very civil, though they searched
the house: I gave them some money, and they
went away, promising that nothing more should be
done to my house; but my only confidence is in
the Lord. They wanted to go from the roof of
my house to that of a rich neighbour&#8217;s of mine,
but I told them I could not allow that they
should make my house a passage to his, and they
were very civil and did not press it.</p>

<p>A Frenchman who was teaching the Pasha&#8217;s
soldiers European discipline, has had his house
stripped, and when they were on the point of
killing him he turned Mohammedan. Before he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
was professedly a Roman Catholic, but really an
infidel.</p>

<p>Oh, my dear Mary, what a contrast to your
kingdom of peace and love! Lord Jesus come
quickly. For this I can now truly bless God that
she is freed from this season of trouble and anxiety.
The dear children bear it better than I could have
hoped; but the Lord sustains and comforts us in
the hope that as the new Pasha is near, this state
of inquietude may not continue long. The Pasha
of Mosul and an Arab chief have entered the city,
and are now at the palace, so thank God, the state
of anarchy is likely to be immediately put an end to.
The crier has been publishing the determination
of those now acting for the new Pasha, till he
enters to punish all who commit any depredations,
and desiring that the bazaars may be opened, and
every one go about his own work. Should this
be the end, we cannot but bless God that so
great a storm has passed over so lightly. But the
fact was, that the plague had destroyed all the
powers of resistance. All Daoud Pasha&#8217;s soldiers
were dead&mdash;all his public servants were dead&mdash;and
he, though recovering from the plague, unable
to take any active part for himself. When
he passed our house this morning, he was supported
on his horse by six men. He is not yet
killed, and on his expressing a wish to have his
son brought to him, he was sent for immediately.
Should they spare his life, it may augur that even
the Turks are coming to a sense of their barbarism.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
It has been a great comfort to me to-day,
to think on Noah&#8217;s case, that God did not forget
him amidst a condemned world.</p>

<p><em>June 14.</em>&mdash;The people at the head of affairs
have now begun to quarrel among themselves:
some are for killing Daoud Pasha, some are for
saving him, and the opposite parties are fighting
in all directions; so when these troubles will
terminate, or how, we have little knowledge. Our
only resting place is in him who is the Shepherd
of the fold of Israel.</p>

<p>The Pasha of Mosul has been made prisoner,
and part of the palace has been burnt and plundered:
they have killed or put to flight the soldiers
of the Pasha of Mosul, who came here as
the agent of Ali Pasha, of Aleppo, the successor
to Daoud Pasha, said to have been appointed
by the Porte. The crier has again proclaimed
Daoud as Pasha, and Saleh Beg his kaimacam
or representative, till he recovers. Some say the
Pasha of Aleppo is dead of the plague; some,
that he is not coming, and that this entrance of
the Pasha of Mosul and a famous Arab chief, was
only a plot of theirs to get Bagdad into their
own hands. What is true, what is false, it is
now utterly impossible to tell, or what the result
will be; but should Ali Pasha, if he is alive,
be now sufficiently powerful to advance and attempt
to dispossess this man, we may expect dreadful
scenes. Last night the contest ended in plundering
the poor Jews.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Amidst this turmoil and interminable contention,
a missionary with a family has much to try his
faith, particularly in the early years of his missionary
course, when he has no power in the language
to take advantage of those opportunities
which accidentally present themselves; for I am
daily more and more convinced of the difficulty of
speaking so as to be felt; at least in the first
Eastern language one learns. The association of
ideas, the images of illustration, are almost entirely
different in many cases. The organs of pronunciation
require a perfect new modelling, and perhaps not
the least difficulty is to prevent one&#8217;s heart from
sinking at the little apparent progress made in
understanding, and being understood, out of the
common routine of daily life: the feeling will
often arise, Surely I never shall learn. The difficulty
is not, however, merely in words; you have
to converse in the East generally with persons
who have either no ideas on subjects of the deepest
interest, or have attached some entirely different
meaning to the terms you use to express those
ideas; and which of the two occasions the most
trouble, it is difficult to say. Notwithstanding,
however, all difficulties, and all discouragements,
and we seem now in the very centre of all, my
soul was never more assured of the value of missionary
labours among any people, it matters not
whom, than now. There is, I am sure, what our
blessed Lord declares, a <em>testimony</em>, in whatever
measure we can proclaim his truth, or manifest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
his spirit, that is felt by those even who will
not embrace it savingly. In reading Mrs. Judson&#8217;s
journal of the trials of the Burman mission, how
deeply I now enter into them&mdash;how truly I can
sympathize with them. It is wonderful how the
Lord does sustain the heart when the time of trial
comes. When I heard the struggle at the palace,
last night, then saw it on fire, and heard the balls
whizzing over our heads, and shortly after the
screams of the poor Jews, whom they were plundering,
a little way from the end of our street, my
heart felt a repose in God that I cannot describe,
and a peace that nothing but confidence in his
loving care could give me, I feel assured. At
times I feel so utterly useless, so devoid of every
aptitude for the work in which I am engaged, that
I wonder the Lord called me to it, yet the Lord
may allow me to fill a place, though it be the
lowest in missionary service. My greatest earthly
treasure is the love of those who love the Lord,
and in this I do feel rich, unworthy as I am of it.
My heart longs for Christian communion; but such
is the state of things here, that I feel almost as
far from the prospect as when the first letter
arrived from England, telling me so many were
purposing to come. But what an inducement it
is to patience to know, that all our trials and
disappointments are the orderings of him who loved
us, and gave himself for us.</p>

<p>The day is passing quietly over, thank God;
and they are removing the barricades from the
streets.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
<em>June 15.</em>&mdash;The account has just reached us,
that the Pasha of Mosul was put to death last
night. The reason assigned is, that he attacked
Bagdad without any warrant, and had detained
at Mosul the Tartars who were bringing the firman
for Daoud Pasha. Oh! what a country,
and what a government! Should the reinstatement
of Daoud Pasha not be a truth, these circumstances
will tend greatly to embitter the contest,
and make the occupying of the city by the
new Pasha a much more destructive and trying
scene, than if these events had not occurred; but
I feel that the Lord is disciplining, by these trials,
the poor weak faith of his servant to lay hold on
his strength, and not to rest on his own. I now
give up all hope of seeing the dear brethren
from Aleppo till the autumn. These scenes of
anxiety and trouble strongly urge the heart forward
to desire the day of the Lord to come, so
wretched, so comfortless does all appear. I have
quite given up the little we have to plunder, so
that I feel quite at ease on that point, should it
be the Lord&#8217;s will to allow these scenes to continue,
and us thus to be served. For the moment
a season of lawlessness commences, you see the
Mohammedan feeling relative to Christians. Now,
for instance, that meat is scarce, if they see a
butcher disposed to give a Christian some before
them, they instantly put themselves into an attitude
of hostility, and say, &ldquo;What! will you give
it to these infidels before us?&rdquo; The other day,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
during the time of the disturbances in the city, the
son of one of the most respectable Armenians
here, went out, armed with pistol, sword, and
gun to the coffee-house. They immediately began
with saying, &ldquo;What does this infidel with
arms? Will he kill Moslems?&rdquo; and they stripped
him of all. The governing powers are beginning
to recognize and feel the strength of those people
called Christians; but this is never the thought of
an Arab populace, who care for none of these
things, and only think of present plunder.</p>

<p>I have finished reading the account of the Burmese
mission, and sympathize much more fully
with the sufferers, than when I last read it, and I
greatly admire and bless God for their steady and
persevering devotedness to his holy service,
amidst so many trials and so many discouragements.
Such manifestations of the grace of Christ,
tend much to encourage and strengthen the hands
and hearts of those who are in any trials, whether
similar or different. Whoever proves God to be
among his dear children, becomes necessarily a
light to the Church, for the Lord surely will be
faithful to his promise and to his children&#8217;s confidence;
and the manifestation of this his faithfulness
becomes the light of others.</p>

<p><em>June 16.</em> (<em>Friday.</em>)&mdash;To-day all quiet within
the city.</p>

<p><em>June 17.</em>&mdash;For some weeks past hope and fear
have alternated for my sweet little baby; but to-day
hope finds not a place for her foot to rest on.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
I see the Lord has sent his message for her also;
this comes very, very heavy; for from some days
previous to dear Mary&#8217;s death till now, I have
been her constant nurse, and solicitude about her
has in some measure served to distract my attention
from the undivided dwelling on my heavier
loss, till she has become so accustomed to my
nursing, that as soon as ever she sees me, she
stretches out her little supplicating hands for me
to take her. All this has served to beguile my
heart, and keep it in some degree occupied. But
when the Lord takes from me this sweet little
flower, I shall indeed be desolate. Why the
Lord thus strips me, I do not now see; yet he
does not allow me to doubt his love, amidst all my
sorrows, and I know that light is sown for me,
though it does not yet spring up. Oh! may my
soul never cease to feel assured of my heavenly
Father&#8217;s unchangeable love; for with a doubt on
this head <em>now</em>, what would my circumstances be?
We know that tribulation worketh patience, and
patience experience, and experience hope, and
hope maketh not ashamed. Oh! may such a result
spring from all my suffering!</p>

<p><em>June 26.</em>&mdash;For some days I have had nothing to
write about from without. All has been, on the
whole, quiet, and we now wait for communications
from Constantinople to see how things are likely
to end. It appears now that Daoud Pasha has
retired in favour of Saleh Beg, whether willingly
or from necessity, is not known. The treasury
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
and every thing else is given up into his hand;
and he knows as well how to spend it as his predecessor
did to collect it; he is therefore popular,
but not esteemed by those of more understanding
as a man of abilities. He, however, goes to the
old Pasha Daoud every day for instructions.</p>

<p>How all these events will operate upon our
future labours, I cannot at all conceive; whether
they will close up the little opening we had, or
make a wider one, the Lord, on whom we wait,
alone knows. I have been reading much lately
of missionary labours, and am surprised to find
how uniformly trials, and difficulties, and threatened
destruction have hung over them for years,
yet many of them the Lord has since singally
blessed. We are, however, in the Lord&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>I have just read through a second time Mr.
Wolff&#8217;s journal, and Mr. Jowett&#8217;s second volume,
and I confess that if my little experience entitles
me to give my opinion, I think Mr. Jowett&#8217;s
judgment much the soundest as to the nature
of the operations to be carried on in these countries;
that the missionary corps should be as unencumbered
as possible, and ready to remove at
a moment&#8217;s notice. I mean those engaged in the
simple evangelist&#8217;s office, disconnected from all
secular callings; but should there be a band of
enlightened saints, willing to take the handicraft
departments of life, as their means of support,
and unobserved access to the people, they might
remain and carry on their work, when other and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
more ostensible teachers were obliged to fly: and
this is doubtless the way the primitive churches
were nourished, when their professed teachers fled.</p>

<p>As to those colleges and large establishments
contemplated by Mr. Wolff, even could they be
established on the comprehensive principle proposed
by his zealous and ardent mind, I fear it
would lead much more to the diffusion of universal
scepticism than the eternal excellency of the
truth of God; if, I say, it could be attained, but for
many reasons I feel it cannot be attained. The
liberality of the Christian public is not up to such
undertakings, even though they saw the utility
to be clear. One cannot help being struck with
Mr. Wolff&#8217;s judging of others from himself; because
he felt he was willing to make sacrifices, he
promised for others as freely as for himself: but
what has been the result even of the two schools
he did establish, and promise to support from the
funds of his patron and others? The burthen has
rested on those who were persuaded through him
of the willingness of others to co-operate. One
is given up, and the other has dwindled down to
about nineteen pupils, and these are educated on
the native plan, so that, as far as divine light is
concerned, it is in <em>statu quo</em>. The two colleges
that were to be established at Aleppo and Tabreez,
and towards which a beginning was made in
promises and plans&mdash;nothing now is heard of them;
nor do I think it is to be regretted. The object
was too mixed for much of spiritual prosperity.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
The difficulty is not in getting houses and firmans:
it is when you begin to wish to sit down and
attack the strong holds of the enemy. The same
with the letters of patriarchs and bishops: when
the thing is new and they see not its bearings on
their system, they are all friendliness&mdash;as among
the heads of the Armenians, the Catholics, and
other Bishops. But when they have seen the
life-giving power of the divine word in the souls
of two or three of their followers, under the instruction
of such clear brethren as at Shushee, or
the American brethren, all is changed, and when
dear Zaremba was at Ech-Miazin the other day,
and endeavoured to get the consent of the Armenian
patriarch to the translation of the Scriptures,
by Dittrich, his reception was every thing
but kind; and they have actually dragged away
one of their deacons from the dear brethren at
Shushee, to try him at Ech-Miazin for heresy.
I have also heard that the bishop of Ispahan, who
superintends all these countries, even as far as
India, has prohibited the reception of any tracts
by his people, and would not let them have a
school till the Roman Catholics appeared there
and established one, taking away some of his flock,
when he granted it. In fact, wherever the hierarchical
spirit exists, there a spirit of domination
and pride&mdash;there a spirit of Antichrist exists&mdash;whether
in the Brahmin, the Mufti, or the Patriarch,
there is a body of men who will not go in
themselves, nor let others go in; it must be so, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Mr. Jowett justly observes, wherever the distinction
between laity and clergy is kept up in opposition
to the right and duty of each man to judge
for himself. Mr. Jowett&#8217;s words are, I think,
&ldquo;The principal religious characteristic of Syria
and the Holy Land, (and he might have added,
of all the ancient churches, and too many of the
modern,) that which is common to all its professors
and sects, is that <em>system of distinction between
priesthood and laity</em>, felt even when not avowed;
according to which, it seems to be the interest of
a few professed teachers to hold the rest of their
fellow-creatures in darkness.&rdquo; Those men, therefore,
who, in a hasty visit, welcome you, and if
you are well introduced, flatter you, no sooner
see or feel your real design, than they become your
enemies, and the missionary who should begin
with any other expectation from present prospects,
must be disappointed. For instance, had we been
where there was a powerful clergy, we should have
met with the greatest opposition in our school, because
of our casting out of it the book which they
so highly prize, called the Shammakirke. Yet no
Christian teacher could conscientiously allow it&mdash;it
was full of prayers to the Virgin, the Cross, &amp;c. &amp;c.;
we therefore here succeeded, under God&#8217;s blessing,
because the laity were strong and the priesthood
weak, without any serious struggle; but their progress
has been very different at Shushee.</p>

<p>The morals of the monks at Ech-Miazin are
such that no parent in the country thinks himself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
justified in sending his child there to be educated.
From such men, what can you expect? With
them what can you do? I have for a long time
been persuaded that the path for a child of God
to pursue, is to follow his Lord, and not to ask
the Sanhedrim&#8217;s leave to preach the truth; and
never to take any notice of them till they take
notice of us. Dark as the cloud seems to be now
around these lands, and difficult as it seems
even to live in them, much more to labour in
them; yet I do not at all think, to one having patiently
attained a thorough knowledge of the colloquial
Arabic, and the other colloquial languages
in use, that the door is barred to a travelling
unsettled missionary, or even to one resident many
months in a place: neither do I think he should
be discouraged from attempting schools, for
although they may not stand above a year or two,
you may by the Lord&#8217;s blessing be the instrument
of stirring up their minds to think and examine for
themselves, and without violence lead them to
question the truth of some of their dogmas; and
when you have once dislodged the principle of
implicit faith, you have at last opened the door
for truth. I think it is much to be regretted that
Mr. Wolff&#8217;s wishes about Bussorah and Bushire
did not succeed. In the one there is a permanent
British Resident, and in the other a permanent
British influence, that would have much favoured
a school, and even perhaps finally more extensive
operations; and I do still hope he may yet find
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
some of his friends, who are as able as willing
to take the necessary charge of these places, for
they are now more disheartened than when nothing
had been promised them. At Tabreez also, I
think a most interesting school might be established;
but let it be as comprehensive as it can
with a safe conscience be, without pretending to a
principle that includes all. If, upon such terms
Mohammedans come, your conscience is not entangled,
and you can go on steadily with your work.
If they go, they go; if they stay, they stay; but
take care how you take any of the gentiles by
solicitation; it will tie your hands, and hamper all
your proceedings. It looks promising to see the
names of Princes and great men connected with
our work; but I am persuaded that it is utterly
spiritual weakness. Better do ever so little work
with the whole soul, than ever so much, trimming
between the world and the Church, and all very
comprehensive plans must involve this: besides,
from the outset, the feeling of duplicity that always
must result from inducing men to contribute to
support institutions under certain partial
representations, which they would not embrace if you
stated your real design, and the full truth.</p>

<p>Besides these difficulties of money and principle,
the unsettled state of these countries is such that
learned orientalists would never come, even if
they were in abundance; but the fact is, that even
Europe is very scantily supplied with men who
could direct such an institution, and if they could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
be found, unless the love of Christ were the
spring of their actions&mdash;were they mere literary
orientalists, their influence as it regards the
kingdom of Christ would be worse than nugatory.
For though you might hope to correct this evil by
having others connected with the institution who
might have the more immediate spiritual direction
of the students, this would soon lead to strifes
and divisions between the heads of the institution.
That the spread of literature in the East will sap
and finally overthrow <em>Mohammedanism</em>, I have
little doubt; but this is the work of the men of
the world, and the result, as it regards Christianity,
very doubtful; but the missionary&#8217;s object
is one and indivisible: if Christ be not glorified,
he gains nothing; but if he be but exalted, he
has his rich reward.</p>

<p><em>June 28.</em> <em>Thursday.</em>&mdash;There seems just sufficient
strength in this wretched country to destroy
itself: it has long lost the power of attacking its
enemies with success, it has also lost the power of
resistance against their attacks, neither can it longer
stand without external support: there seems just
sufficient power left to commit suicide. In this
pashalic, though the Sultan cannot without extreme
difficulty remove the Pasha, yet he effectually
destroys its prosperity;&mdash;he ruins the merchant, he
encourages every species of robbery, so that frequently,
as at present, not a shop dare be opened but
for the simplest necessaries. Nor does it operate
against the prosperity of this city only, but all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
trade of which this was a sort of intermediate place
of transit between India, Mosul, Merdin, Damascus,
and Aleppo, as well as on the other side from Europe,
is so far interrupted, for not a merchant will
now venture his goods across the desert. All attachment
too seems entirely destroyed between the head
and the members of the empire.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash; was with me
to-day, who, speaking on the state of the Pashalic
said, If the Sultan will let us have Daoud Pasha
well, we neither want the Sultan nor a stranger;
but we would rather put ourselves under the English,
and let them govern as they do in Hindoostan.
This feeling is exceedingly general, and in
looking forward to the downfall of the empire,
they seem quite to consider this country as the
portion which will fall to England, and speak of
it openly as a thing they desire. This arises from
their hearing so much of our government in India.</p>

<p><em>June 29.</em>&mdash;My dear little baby has had an
attack of purulent ophthalmia, which gives me much
anxiety; for three or four days she had been recovering
a little, when this trying attack seized her
dear little eyes; she was quite unable to open
either of them.</p>

<p>My mind has been much exercised these two
days by reflections on the ease with which the
soul is taken off from living in Christ. In
prosperity, we are occupied with plans; in
adversity, with our sorrows; in missionary
labour, in preparation for what we intend to
do for the Lord, and even in our very times of
danger we are constantly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
exposed to the temptation of looking for
relief to circumstances, rather than to the Lord of
circumstances&mdash;to the love of the Lord of life.
May the Lord of his great goodness grant that my
soul may reap a full harvest from these reflections,
and determine not only in words to know nothing
but Jesus Christ and him crucified, as the subject
of preaching, but as the object on which my soul
constantly dwells, so that growing up into his fulness
in understanding and love, may be the business
of my future life, and much, yea, very much
more, the simple purpose of my heart than it has
ever yet been. Nothing can be to me clearer than
that the work of the Lord will really prosper in the
hands of his servants, in proportion as these servants
prosper in their nearness to him. May his love,
his life, his words, his wishes be the abiding
incentives in my soul to simply living to him and
for him, and for his creatures through him. How
easy it is for one person to make one class of
sacrifices, and another, another; but how hard to slay
the darling idol, and to tear away the cherished
indulgence:&mdash;how easy it is to exercise those
graces which accord with our natural constitutions,
how difficult those which mortify and run counter
to them.</p>

<p>May it be the labour and delight of my future
life to see each cherished idol one by one fall
prostrate, slain before my Lord&#8217;s love.</p>

<p><em>July 1.</em>&mdash;There has just been a transaction
passing which illustrates, in a striking manner, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
very loose connections which bind the parts of
this empire together. I have already mentioned
the death of the Pashas of Mosul and Merdin.
Ali Pasha, in support of whom they had professedly
marched against Bagdad, sent his treasurer to
Saleh Beg, to commend him for what he had
done in thus preserving the city by killing these
two Pashas, requiring at the same time for himself,
the payment of his expenses, as well as a
sum of money for the Sultan, and promising that
if this were given him he would return to Aleppo.
Thus, after nearly two years confusion, all parties
will be worse off than they were before. My
reason for thinking it probable this will be the
case is, that the Khaznadar or treasurer of
Daoud Pasha, has accompanied the Khaznadar
of Ali Pasha to his camp, who evidently doubts
the result of his attempt. Indeed, it seems
very doubtful if in any case he can succeed;
for if he obtains the Pashalic, I think it very
probable from the history of former Pashas, who,
as strangers to the Pashalic, have been forced
into it, that he will not be allowed to retain it.
The fact is, that almost all his opposing force consists
of Arabs, who become in a moment the
servants of the highest bidder. It was only two
days ago the Pasha detached one tribe from them;
and I have little doubt that if he does not spare
money he may soon break up all the
confederacy.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Yesterday the soldiers of the late Pasha of Mosul
came to the gates of the town, but were driven
back into their encampment with loss; and one
hundred of their mercenary troops (Arnaoots)
came over to this Pasha, changing a pay of forty-eight
piasters a month to one hundred, or about
a pound sterling a month.</p>

<p>Every kind of provision is becoming extremely
dear, from double to ten times its usual price;
and I confess I see no present prospect of
improvement, for the inundation swept away the
harvest, and the plague has extended so far, that
there have been no hands to cut down even that
grain which remained, and the things which they
might have sown, and which might in some measure
have supplied the place of grain they were prevented
from sowing by the Arabs, who were at enmity
with the Pasha, and therefore laid waste the
country. In contemplating the perplexity and uncertainty
of events, according to all human calculation,
that surrounds us, the knowledge that our own
Lord is ordering all things not only for his own
glory but also for ours, comes home continually
to my soul with inexpressible comfort; and
notwithstanding the anxious thoughts that sometimes
arise, I am generally enabled at last to roll my
burdens on his holy head, and this I know will
sustain them.</p>

<p>The dead weight about a missionary&#8217;s neck in
the first years of his labour is the language. So
difficult is it to hear so as to understand, or to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
speak so as to be understood; for not only is it
necessary to use right words, but with right accents,
or you may often convey the very reverse
of what you mean. Certainly, if I were quite
alone, the plan I should pursue, would be to go
into some family or place where the language I
wish to learn alone is spoken, as brother King did
in Syria to learn Arabic:&mdash;this being attained, a
missionary is certainly not without the most
interesting opportunities of usefulness.</p>

<p><em>July 2.</em> <em>Saturday.</em>&mdash;Dear baby has suffered
so much from her eyes to-day, that it tried my
heart to the very bottom. And in addition to all
this, the state of things here is assuming an alarming
aspect. Without the city walls, the numbers
of those who wish to plunder the city are increasing;
and within, the same tendency is manifested
among those who are intended for its protection,
so that my heart has been at times very much
pressed down; yet the Lord has sustained me.
In the evening, as I was looking out, I saw the
man come into the court yard, who brings and
collects letters for Aleppo, and in his hand a letter
for me. With what eagerness did I seize it, and
anticipate its contents. Yet though good tidings,
because tidings of the Lord&#8217;s blessing them, and
being in the midst of them, it contained tidings
peculiarly heavy for me to receive at this moment,
as it not only led me to anticipate no present
prospect of seeing my dear brethren from Aleppo,
but that it seemed very doubtful if it would be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
their path to come at all; at least if they did, it
would be purely to join me, and this surely would
not be the path of duty. I, however, receive this
last trying providence at my loving Father&#8217;s hands,
adoring his love whilst I know not the modes of
his going forth. It has not weighed me down so
much as I thought it would; and the Lord allows
me to feel assured he will yet do something for
me. They seem to wish me to join them, but I
do not yet see my way clear to leave this place to
which the Lord has brought me. I feel daily
more and more that my place in the church is very
low, and it matters very little where I am for any
good that is in me: yet by remaining, I keep the
way open for those who are more able, and whose
establishment is more important. I know my
Lord will not cut me off from personal improvement
by all his darkly gracious dealing, and perhaps
I am now learning another part of that hard
lesson, neither to glory in or trust in man. But
still I bless God he is giving my dear brethren a
door of utterance and prospects of usefulness
where they are, and may my joy ever be in proportion
to the glory that is brought to his blessed
name, and the prosperity of his kingdom. Until
the Lord, therefore, raises his fiery cloudy pillar,
and bids me forth, I shall pursue my plan of
endeavouring to converse in Arabic till the Lord is
pleased to open my mouth by degrees, or as he
please, to publish his whole truth. Should he
send me some dear brother to help and comfort
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
me, may he give me grace to praise him; if not,
to hope in him and find in himself all I need.
To the dear boys it has been a great disappointment,
for it was the constant theme of their
conversation, and a cheering expectation to see
friends from England. However, our dear Father
will order all things well; and I bless him
exceedingly for sending out to Aleppo, our dear
brethren and sisters. The Lord may make this
event, which now seems so awakening and trying,
yet for the furthering of the gospel in these lands:
in fact, I should be almost sorry for <em>all</em> of
the brethren to leave Aleppo.</p>

<p><em>July 5.</em> <em>Tuesday.</em>&mdash;I have had some interesting
conversation with three poor people from
<em>Karakoosh</em>,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
a town about five hours from Mosul,
composed of Roman Catholic Syrians. Every information
I receive from that quarter, convinces
me that Erzeroum, Diarbekr, and Mosul, would
be most interesting head quarters for a missionary.
The man told me that the Nestorians of the mountains,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
(like the Scotch) go once a year to receive the
sacrament, whether upon their erroneous principle,
or that from living scattered among the
mountains they cannot make it convenient to meet
often, I know not. The Syrians of the villages
near Mosul speak among themselves Syriac, but in
asking them if they understood the old Syriac,
which is read, they reply, imperfectly; so that I
have no doubt, for any instructive purpose, it is
perfectly unintelligible, what with the mode of
reading, and the difference of language. These
are deeply interesting countries to those who can
be happy in bestowing all their strength in planting
under the prospect that others will reap the
fruits. The Lord will water their way with little
streams of comfort, and manifestations of the
prospect of the future; but the preparatory work
in these countries must occupy at least many, many
years of missionary life. I shall never feel a
missionary till I can deliver my message clearly
and intelligibly; till then, I endeavour to drop a
word, as it may be offered, and to instil a principle
as an occasion may occur, or by seeking an occasion.
The difficulty of this first step I daily feel
to be increasing&mdash;I mean only that my sense of
the difficulty is increasing; but the Lord daily
comforts me, amidst the delays and trials of faith,
by the clearest conviction of the large sphere of
usefulness there is when once this is attained.</p>

<p>All things in the city continue in the most unsettled
state.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Some of the lawless depredators came again
to our house the day before yesterday, and wanted
arrack; but they went away quietly, and they
only talked about cutting off my head; but all this
in mere bravado. The Lord thus graciously takes
care of us. They look on me as a sort of dervish,
because I do not drink arrack, nor use weapons
of war, nor take men to guard my house.</p>

<p><em>July 9.</em>&mdash;The camp of those without the
city is moving down to-day towards us; and we
hear a continued firing of cannon. It is reported
they are come within half an hour&#8217;s march of the
city. The issue is in the Lord&#8217;s hand. Nothing
can exceed the fear and want of confidence that
prevails throughout the city, every man&#8217;s heart
failing him for fear of those things which may be
coming on us. Oh! what a resting place is the
Lord&#8217;s experienced love, and the assurance that
all shall work together for good to those that love
him; yet living thus in the midst of constant
alarm, makes my heart sometimes long for that
sweet, quiet Christian communion which I left
behind in England.</p>

<p><em>July 10.</em> <em>Sunday.</em>&mdash;In conversation to-day on the
subject of invoking the Virgin Mary, with some
Armenians and a Jacobite, I was struck with the
readiness with which they all submit to Scripture;
and this seems universal among all those who are
not ecclesiastics by profession, or Roman Catholics.
The curse of obstinate blindness seems to
be left to those who join this apostate church, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
truly it may be said of them, they come not to
the light, because their deeds are evil&mdash;not their
deeds as members of society, but as professed
members of the mystical body of Christ.</p>

<p>Our Lord&#8217;s days are solitary&mdash;none to tune
Zion&#8217;s harps. Oh! how it makes the soul long
for the courts of the Lord, where we may go up
with the crowds to keep holiday; how precious
now would appear some of those seasons of Christian
communion which we enjoyed in dear England
and Ireland. When dear Mary was with
me, we had an unceasing source of happiness in
conversing on our common hopes in our common
Lord. Our communion also with our dear friends
was thus rendered vivid, aided as it was and encouraged
by the help of correspondence and conversation;
but now letters have almost ceased to
come, and I have no one to commune with. In
addition to all this we are besieged, and every
necessary of life is nearly three times its usual
price, very bad, and to be got with difficulty. All
night we hear nothing but firing and drums
beating, and men shouting&mdash;all this, too, at present,
without any prospect of termination, for those
who are come against the city, are not strong
enough to enforce the change they design, and
those within have little to fear, so long as they
have money and provisions to give the soldiers,
which they say they have for two
years;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
so those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
who suffer are the poor people, who cannot help
themselves. The Pasha of Aleppo is about an
hour&#8217;s distance; it does not seem to be his wish
to act offensively against the city, but only to get
into his power those few whom he wishes to displace
and behead. Yet how much have I to bless
God for, in that he keeps the little boys so free
from alarm. Blessed Lord! these are indeed
scenes and times that lead the soul to desire thy
peaceful happy reign. Sometimes the sense of
my dear, dear Mary&#8217;s peace, safety, and joys,
makes me feel my burthens lighter than though
she had been with me; for to have those you love
in such scenes is trying in proportion to this very
love, which so sweetens times of mere labour or
peace. I am sure the Lord <em>has</em> dealt lovingly,
and <em>will</em>.</p>

<p><em>July 14.</em>&mdash;Since the ninth we have had little
occurring but firing of guns from the citadel, and
the noise and confusion at night occasioned by the
soldiers.</p>

<p>A circumstance has occurred to-day which a
little tries me. The Armenian Priests are both
dead; and the Armenian servant of Mrs. T. has
asked if she might receive the communion with
us, the next time we received it. Now, while I
feel in my own soul that she knows nothing of the
power of the divine life, yet how far I have authority
from God&#8217;s word to set up this, my private
feeling, in the absence of any thing palpable to
fix on as an objection, I do not see. I feel so utterly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
unworthy to place myself in the situation of a
judge in such a case. I feel so exceedingly low
in the divine life&mdash;I experience so little of the
power of that life which was in Christ, subduing
all things to the obedience of the Father&#8217;s will&mdash;that
I feel she may object more to my being accepted
than I could to her. Yet, notwithstanding
all this, I am conscious there is a difference&mdash;though
I am only on the lowest step of Jacob&#8217;s
ladder, yet I do desire to ascend higher into the
unsearchable riches of Christ, and to descend
lower in my own esteem, so to be able to say without
the pollution of affected humility, I feel myself
less than the least of all saints. The divine life
appears to me daily more and more a deep internal
personal work, without which all external exertions
and exercises will come to nothing; however
fair, it will be at best but a fruitless blossom,
that withers as soon as blown. Oh! how difficult
it is not to deceive oneself with the appearance
of Christian graces instead of the substance;
how difficult not to substitute the <em>act</em> for the
<em>spirit</em>; that monster pride, how hard it is to kill,
how chameleon like it changes its colour and seems
to live on air, yea, on very vanity.</p>

<p><em>July 18.</em> <em>Lord&#8217;s Day.</em>&mdash;The warlike sounds of
the cannon and mortars have abated within these
three days. Oh that the Lord would quickly terminate
this hateful civil strife. Yet at present
there seems no prospect.</p>

<p>How hard I feel it to-day to rise above the loss
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
of my dear, dear Mary&mdash;it seems like a new
wound just opened. It is so hard to feel the
great honour and great proof of love the Lord has
manifested towards me, in removing her I loved
from the trials and sorrows of this earth to the ease
and joy of his own Paradise, to join our dear little
Mary, and sing there together his praise who
washed them in his own blood, prepared them as
vessels of honour, and then took them to himself.
Sometimes I think I ought not to have gone out
of our house during the plague, about Major T.&#8217;s
affairs, but that I should have left them to their
own fate; yet, at other times, I think, after all
the kindness I had received from him, I ought
not to have declined the dangerous service. Then
again, I think that when I did go, I should have
taken more precautions, and not have joined my
dear family immediately, but remained apart;
yet at last my heart comes round to the full assurance,
that my dear and loving Lord would not have
visited undesigned neglect, which sprang mainly
from confidence in his loving care, with such a privation,
had he not designed by it her speedy glory
and my final good: now I shall go to her, but she
shall not return to me.</p>

<p>The dear little boys are very anxious to leave
Bagdad, yet they do not complain, nor appear on
the whole otherwise than happy, which is indeed
a great mercy. My poor dear little nursling, the
object of ceaseless care, seems rather gaining than
losing ground, yet is still so frail, that a blast of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
wind seems enough to extinguish the little fire that
burns; but if the Lord will, even this little fire
shall yet burn brighter and brighter, and defy in
his name the rudest blasts.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I think on the complete stop
the Lord has in his infinite wisdom seen fit to put
to my little work here, I am astonished. Among
those who are dead, is one who was translating the
New Testament into the vulgar Armenian of
this place, and had gone as far as Luke; and
another gentleman, who was educated in Bombay,
who was writing for me an English and Armenian
Dictionary, in which he had proceeded about half
way (10,000 words). In this dictionary there were
not only the ancient and modern parallel words,
but an explanation in vulgar Armenian, with
examples. The probability of my meeting with
one similarly qualified, able and willing again, is
very small indeed; but with this, as with all the
rest, it is the Lord, let him do what seemeth to
him good. I wait to see his future pleasure
manifested, and though I am now under a cloud
of sorrow and separation from his service, may he
sanctify it, and advance his glory by whomsoever
he pleases, only giving me a heart to rejoice in
their labours, and to love my Lord fervently, and
then I hope I shall not complain. I never felt
fit for much, and I daily now feel fit for less than
I once thought I was, yet the Lord will not deny
me a place in the body, and oh, may he give me
a heart willing to take the lowest&mdash;that of washing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
the disciples&#8217; feet. Oh, for the spirit of our
dear humble Lord in that wonderful transaction
so calculated to stain human pride with the name
of madness, but especially the pride of those who
call themselves his.</p>

<p>The weather is now getting intensely hot, and
our cellars, which were our retreating places last
year, are not habitable, the water being in them
at least three feet high, and this, with the overflowing
of the river, brought such swarms of mosquitos,
that for several weeks it was almost impossible
to sleep, and although now they are far less
numerous, they are still very troublesome, so that
if not on your guard every moment, you get stung
by them.</p>

<p><em>July 20.</em>&mdash;The weather is intensely hot, and we
now begin seriously to miss the
Serdaubs;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
but I feel it most for dear little baby, to whom the
heat is very, very trying. I also feel it very
difficult to do any thing that requires the least
exertion, and for the next six weeks we have no
hope, of any mitigation, but rather an increase.
The prospect too of affairs around us, leaves no
resting place but in the love and favour of our Lord.
The city is full of prophecies of the sorrows and
desolations that are to come on this land; from
the Pasha downward, this people seem devoted to
astrology, believing lies, while they refuse to hear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
the truth; yet all their visions are of sorrow, lamentation,
and woe.</p>

<p>I feel sometimes very much tried with respect
to my future pursuit of missionary labours; for I
have not only lost the encouragement and comfort
of a sweet society that made every place a home;
but all these domestic cares, which she so willingly
and so entirely bore, have fallen on me, and I
hardly seem, at least during the weakness of my
dear little baby, to have time for any thing but
to attend to them. Had I been joined by our
dear brothers and sisters from Aleppo, it would
have been comparatively light; but now, I can
take no step, and before I may be able, the Lord
may graciously afford me new light; for this I will
therefore, with his grace and help, patiently wait.</p>

<p><em>July 21.</em>&mdash;In some conversation I have just had
with the old father of our late schoolmaster, I
have been encouraged to feel that it is almost
impossible for a missionary, even of the humblest
pretensions, and in the lowest degree qualified
for his calling, which I can I think with unaffected
truth say, I feel to be my own case&mdash;to
live among these people, and not to lead them to
some most important principles. This old man
is not only theoretically persuaded of the sufficiency
of the Scriptures, but in his understanding
fully convinced. His acquaintance with Scripture
is very extensive and accurate, and on my
servant coming to ask him the explanation of
words in the translation lately set forth by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Bible Society, it led to a conversation on the importance
of having a translation that every woman
and child can understand.  He said, &ldquo;Yes,
and it is only the pride of the learned and of the
bishops which prevents it: if books once became
published in the dialects of the people, the old
language would cease to be cultivated.&rdquo; This
would doubtless be an infinite benefit, not only to
the Armenians but to the Syrians and Chaldeans,
and every Church of the East, among the people;
a few learned men may, and most likely will, be
found to extract what is valuable from the old
language, if they have only enlightened judgment
enough to leave the mass of rubbish behind. He
mentioned the sermon on the Mount, which we
received from Shushee, and said, that it opened
the eyes of the children&mdash;yet even this dialect is
very different from the one used here. I think
this aged man understands and feels there is but
one Church in the world; and he quoted that
interesting passage, &ldquo;Paul may plant and Apollos
water, but God giveth the increase,&rdquo; to prove it.</p>

<p><em>July 22.</em>&mdash;I have to-day received letters from
London and Aleppo, and I have reason to bless
God for all; yet they all come armed with sorrow;
for they are full of her of whom the Lord has
emptied me. In my strength I thought I could
so entirely give her up to him, did he desire it,
since he had made her so strong in himself, and
filled her so full of his blessings; well, and even
now, my soul doth magnify the Lord, though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
in so many ways, I still feel my great and trying
loss. Perhaps the Lord has meant to teach me
that the 91st Psalm, as dear brother Cronin
writes, relates only to Christ&#8217;s humanity, specially
shewing how, from his cradle to his grave, his
father watched over him, so that at last he laid
down his life, but none took it from him; and he,
in this great act, has made it over spiritually to
us: he has left the natural plague because of sin,
but destroyed the spiritual because of righteousness,
even that righteousness which is by his own
most precious blood.</p>

<p>The Pasha of Aleppo, hearing of dear Edward
Cronin, as an English physician, wishing to come
to Bagdad, wished to engage him to come with
him as his physician, and offered him 1500 piasters
a month; but, anxious as they were to come,
the circumstances of their party did not, on
mature deliberation, allow them to separate,
and Ali Pasha was unwilling to undertake the
responsibility of the females with his camp. And, oh,
how my soul blesses the Lord, now I think on it,
that these obstacles were so graciously interposed;
disease, delay, and trouble would have accompanied
them, and, till now, they would have been
detained in the desert, with little prospect of
speedy admission into the city, which is firing
against the camp, and the camp firing against the
city, and they would have been exposed to the
full power of a sun, which no one can tell how to
estimate, but by actual exposure to it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
I have also received a letter from Bussorah,
stating that on the drying up of the inundations
there, a fever has been spreading, and carrying off
numbers. Major T.&#8217;s family had most of them
been ill, but they were recovering. Mr. Bathie
was very weak, and his wife dead. Dr. Beagry,
the new surgeon of this station, also died, and
immense numbers of those who had fled from
the plague. Bussorah is still besieged, but expected
soon to fall into the hands of the Motezellim.</p>

<p>A letter has also reached me to-day by the same
conveyance, from the Bible Society, dated 27th
July last year, mentioning the sending of three
cases of Arabic and Persian Scriptures to my dear
brother Pfander. When I consider how God, in
his infinite and unsearchable providence, has seen
it fit to bring to nought all our plans by the
disorganization of this at all times lawless land, I
cannot but feel it a strong call to form very few
plans for the future, and just to work by the day.
Our hope was, when we came to Bagdad, to have
been able to travel pretty extensively both in the
mountains of Kourdistan and in Persia; but the
state of the country, and other considerations,
brought all these plans to nothing, so my dear
friend and kind brother left me for Shushee,
having been able to obtain much of the information
he desired, without the journey. And I, instead
of having a large present field of useful
employment, and one prospectively increasing, am
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
now without employment or prospect, and if it
were not that I feel getting on a little in the
colloquial language of the country, I should be
almost without hope of remaining with advantage
here; but while I feel this, my heart does not
sink. The Lord will yet let his light shine out of
the darkness, and will one day enable me to speak
of his promises; for I daily feel more assured this
is the great gift after which an evangelist is to
press&mdash;it is the very instrument of his labour.
And let such a missionary feel infinitely happier
to hear it said he speaks very low Arabic, but
that every body understands him; than very pure,
but which is unintelligible, except to the Mollahs.
If he speaks not in a very mixed dialect of
Turkish, Persian, and Arabic, he will not be understood
here; there is, however, still an immense
preponderance of Arabic over the others.</p>

<p>The British and Foreign School Society have
also very kindly offered to afford what assistance
their limited means will allow to the furtherance
of Scripture instruction in the East. I shall
endeavour to repay this free kindness by obtaining
the best information I can, before I call on their
aid, for nothing is so discouraging as failures from
precipitate attempts; but so variable is the state
of affairs in these countries, that previous to your
judgment being matured by experience, you may
be led, with the best intentions possible, to
undertake, on a bright day, plans which, before they
can be executed, prove as baseless as a vision, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
which will leave nothing behind but the remembrance
of useless expense and unproductive labour.</p>

<p><em>July 22.</em>&mdash;I had with me to-day, for the last
time as a patient, an officer of the Pasha&#8217;s household
who had the plague, and a large wound from
a carbuncle, but is now quite well, and he was
talking of the state of the city and country, and
said, &ldquo;Why do we wish to give our country into
the hands of the
Ghiaours,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
and not to the Persians?
It is because we know they will neither
take our wives or daughters from us, nor rob us
of our money, nor cut off our heads, but in Islam
there is no mercy, no pity.&rdquo; He added,
&ldquo;Did you ever see me before I came about my
leg?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;you had
mercy upon me, and cured me and my daughter
(who also had had the plague), and why? It was
from your heart&mdash;there was mercy there.&rdquo; I took
this opportunity to explain the reason, as emanating
from the command of Christ, and not the
goodness of my heart, and how truly could I say
it; for the Lord knows how, but for this, it would
be a weariness unto me. Now this impatience of
their own government is not the feeling of a few
discontented men, but I am persuaded it is very
general&mdash;how can such a kingdom stand?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
The government, if government it can be called,
is now sending the soldiers round to every house
to seek for wheat and rice. From some they take
half, from others a third of their little store, while
they have enough for two years in their own corn
cellars, and this too when the necessaries of life are
raised to between four and five times their usual
price; and as for fruit and vegetables, which
constitute in eastern countries, during summer, so
large a portion of the food of all classes, not a
particle is to be seen.</p>

<p>Yesterday and to-day I have had two Roman
Catholic merchants with me, and in quoting
Scripture to them, I found them ready with the
context; but the deadly evil is the separation of
religion and its principles from the government
and rule of every day and every moment. In
these countries, where religious expressions are in
every one&#8217;s mouth, a missionary has most valuable
employment, as he is able to bring their minds
back to their own expressions, to their own import
and power, as we are desired to do to those
who heartlessly use that beautiful form of dedication
in the communion service of the Church of
England, &ldquo;We here present unto thee our bodies,
souls, and spirits to be a reasonable, holy, and
lively sacrifice unto thee.&rdquo; Oh! that all who use
these blessed words felt their power, and lived
under it. Christ&#8217;s name would soon be magnified
from land to land.</p>

<p><em>July 23.</em>&mdash;The Pasha has just sent me a fish,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
with his compliments, and a request that I will
dress it for him: this is the way he collects the
daily provisions for his household; one person
sends him a dish of rice, another a dish of kebaub,
another bread; at other times all this takes place
because of custom, but now from necessity, for he
has no servants scarcely to attend to him. This is
the first time I have been so honoured, and when
the fish was cooked and sent, he desired the servant
to come back, and bring him a few kustawee
dates to eat with it; that, however, you may
not think these any very extravagant luxury, I
may add, their value is somewhat less than a penny
a pound. I note this as a little trait of manners
that one would hardly credit, had not the fact
come under his own observation.</p>

<p><em>July 24.</em> <em>Lord&#8217;s Day.</em>&mdash;Nothing among the
perverted use of scriptural terms has ever struck me
as more remarkable than the use the Church now
makes of the expression, tempting God. In God&#8217;s
word it is uniformly placed among the sins of
unbelief; but the Church now, by universal consent,
places it among the sins of presumption, to which
it is the very antipodes. For instance, it is one of
the great crimes of Israel, their tempting God in
the desert, and limiting the Holy One of Israel.
How? By presumptuous confidence? No&mdash;but
by saying he hath given bread, but <em>can he give
meat</em> also? This is the only sense I know in
scripture given to tempting God, and that famous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
passage from which the erroneous impression has
mainly sprung, in the interview of Satan with
our Lord, is quite kindred. The object of Satan
was to get our Lord&#8217;s mind into a condition of
doubting God, by leading him to argue, God has
certainly said so, but will he do it? for our blessed
Lord was manifestly as much tempting God by
attempting to walk upon the water, as to cast
himself into the air. What proves this to be the
meaning is our Lord&#8217;s quotation, &ldquo;It is written,
Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.&rdquo; Now,
where is this written? Why, in the Old Testament,
where it uniformly implies doubt and distrust;
in Exod. xvii. 2. &ldquo;Therefore the people did
chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that
we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why
chide ye with me? Wherefore do ye tempt the
Lord? And he called the name of the place
Massah and Meribah, because of the chiding of
the children of Israel; and because they tempted
the Lord, saying, <em>Is the Lord among us, or not?</em>&rdquo;
(verse 7.) And it is in reference to this very
passage, that in Deut. vi. 16. it is said &ldquo;Thou shalt
not tempt the Lord thy God, as ye tempted him
in Massah.&rdquo; And that we may not have a doubt
of the meaning, see the application of the word
tempting, as applied to our dear and blessed
Lord. Is it ever in the sense of presumptuous
confidence? Never; but always of scepticism
and doubt. I do not mean to say there is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
not such a sin as presumptuous confidence; I
am sure there is; but that is never called
tempting God. The Israelites were guilty of
this sin, when they went up contrary to the command
of God to fight their enemies, after he had
pronounced upon them the forty years wandering
in the wilderness.</p>

<p>I think that rightly understanding this is a matter
of no small moment; for many are affrighted,
and made sad in the ways of the Lord by the
erroneous application of this Scripture; for to
whom does the Church and the world alike now
apply this term? Why, if they hear of a man
selling his property, and becoming poor, like Barnabas,
according to the exhortation of the apostles,
and the <em>example of our Lord</em>, he is considered
as tempting God by all according to the degree
in which they wish to keep all or part of their
own property. Again, if he exposes himself to
dangers he might avoid, troubles he might escape,
for what he believes the Lord&#8217;s service, far from
receiving any comfort or encouragement, he is
again accused of tempting God. But tempting
God is the deadly sin of an unregenerate mind,
and is never charged on any saint, either in the
Old or New Testament, that I recollect. Certainly,
Peter did not tempt Christ, when he said,
&ldquo;If thou be he, bid me come unto thee on the
water;&rdquo; for he did not doubt our Lord&#8217;s power;
yet there was a measure of false confidence in
himself, as well as of unbelief; but these are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
compatible with the holiest affections as a state.
Tempting God belongs to the family of the
tempter, and is a part of no child of God at any
time. After his conversion, Peter asked a miracle
of Christ; but it was in faith, however
weak. When the sceptical Sadducees and the
Pharisees, sought a sign it was to try him, can he
do it? Therefore he said, Why tempt ye me, ye
hypocrites? shewing it was a sin to tempt him as
well as it was a sin to tempt his Father.</p>

<p>I feel now that I had been led to expect a
greater measure of freedom from the troubles
which fall on the people, in the midst of which
I find myself, than the dispensation under
which I live warranted; I do not mean from
those which spring directly out of the Lord&#8217;s
service, but those natural and national evils
which God sends as judgments on the ungodly.
This error arose from considering the
temporal promises of the 91st Psalm, and other
similar ones in multitudes of places, as the legitimate
objects of faith: whereas I have been now
led to see that they, like the curses, are but typical
representations of that kingdom in which the
saints of the Lord shall rejoice and be safe when
his enemies are swept away as the chaff of the summer
threshing floor. Yet even now, spiritually they
are all ours. Not a hair of our head shall fall to
the ground without our heavenly Father&#8217;s permission.
Therefore I feel these thoughts ought
neither to trouble us, nor any more prevent our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
hand undertaking for Christ any service, than if
a greater exemption was promised; for we know
that whatever is allowed to befall us, whether natural
or spiritual, if Christ is ours and we are
his, they shall only so operate as to work out for
us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
glory; for these sufferings and trials must be
among all the things that work together for good
to those who love Christ.</p>

<p><em>July 28.</em> <em>Thursday.</em>&mdash;Up to this time the
shells and balls of the besiegers have done us no
harm. Two shells have passed just over us. The
one fell on the roof of the house of an Arab family
at a little distance from us, who were all asleep,
and on bursting killed three: one cannon ball has
just passed over us, besides musket balls innumerable,
only two of which, however, I have felt so
near as to endanger us. The one just passed by
me and struck the wall, the other, by bending my
head, passed just over me: yet dangerous as it
seems in such circumstances to sleep on the roof,
the suffocating heat of the rooms is insupportable.
I recollect Mr. Wolff, when here, mentions it
as so hot that he could not write his journal, and
indeed such is the heat, that one unaccustomed
to it feels almost perfectly unfitted for any laborious
service either of mind or body, but particularly
the former, for at least my own experience
is, that the body is much less affected by it
than the mind.</p>

<p>Famine is making its destructive way here
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
among the poor. All the necessaries of life are
raised from four to six times their usual price, and
often are not to be obtained at all, and in addition
there is no labour going on in the city: every
shop is closed, and every one&#8217;s concern is to take
care of his life or property. They are constantly
killing persons in the streets, without the
least inquiry being made after the perpetrators;
nay, they are publicly and notoriously known,
and no one regards it. Nothing can exceed the
misery and fear that pervades the city. Yet
amidst all these perplexities and troubles, the
Lord reigns, and without him they can do nothing.</p>

<p><em>July 31.</em> <em>Lord&#8217;s day.</em>&mdash;A day that always dawns
with sweet peace on my soul: I seem more
especially to bring before my mind those with
whom I think I took sweet counsel, and went
to the house of God in company; and though
now deprived of all that the heart can desire
from holy fellowship on earth, there is something
that brings me near those I love, when I
think on their places of assembly, and their
times of prayer. Though my dear Lord has
broken my heart in pieces, and his hand is still
resting on me in the person of my dear little
dying baby, whose love and preference for the
little care I know how to show, renders it one
of those exquisitely painful trials, that the feelings
know not how to obey the Lord in, when the
spiritual judgment is brought quite down. Yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
I can never help feeling it to be a mercy eternally
to be thankful for, that the sense of my
Father&#8217;s love and Saviour&#8217;s sympathy has never
been taken from me amidst all my trials; nay,
I do feel that the Lord is fitting me, by suffering
and separation, for the work to which he has
called me; he leaves me without a home, or the
desire of one, and in that way prepares me for
situations, which, during the life-time of my
dearest Mary, would have been deeply trying.
I bless God for the fourteen years uninterrupted
domestic happiness we enjoyed together, above
all, for the seven years spiritual communion in a
common gracious Lord, who led us in unity of
faith and spirit to that work from which he has
taken her so early to himself, and from which,
when the Lord dismisses me, I trust to ascend
and sing the song of Moses and the Lamb with
her for ever and ever. My great want is, more
of Christ, more of his whole character; this I
purpose, by the Spirit&#8217;s help, more to meditate
on, that all that hateful concern about self, that
pollutes all I do, may be absorbed in one only
thought of how he may be glorified. What I
feel I want, is more holiness of spirit. I know
the Lord is fitting me for his holy presence, and
that he is the chief desire of my soul; yet, oh!
the weakness of faith, the coldness of communion,
the reserves of dedication. Oh, Lord, I believe;
help thou mine unbelief!</p>

<p>A Mohammedan has been with me to-day,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
who is much alarmed at the state of the city,
and wants to fly, but sees not now any opening.
He told me, it was not this or that Pasha he
cared about; but his property, his life, and the
females of his family. Oh, what a relief to
know, that my dear Mary is with her Lord; how
light this makes my present trials. Yesterday
they were fighting from before sun-rise till the
afternoon, but could not effect an entrance into
the city. The Lord preserves us all in simple
dependence on himself.</p>

<p><em>August 2.</em> <em>Wednesday.</em>&mdash;Accounts have arrived
from the Hajjaj (Mecca and Medina, &amp;c.)
stating the mortality from plague and cholera
to be most tremendous; many families that left
this place on pilgrimage to escape the troubles,
in the midst of which we have so long been,
have, as we hear, suffered dreadfully. Thus
God seems in wrath, making bare his holy arm
against this wretched nation in all its length and
breadth. My heart sometimes trembles for the
dear brethren at Aleppo, lest at the conclusion
of the hot season it should break out there. My
only resource is God. The poor people here are
beginning to sell their little all to buy bread, and
in consequence of the badness and scarcity of
provisions, dysentery is spreading its ravages in
every direction, as well as fever.</p>

<p>I have had with me to-day the translator to
the late French Bishop, and two or three Roman
Catholic merchants, all overwhelmed with fear.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
They say, the Sultan, on hearing of the death of
the Pasha of Mosul, and the Vaivode of Merdin,
has written to the Pasha of Aleppo, to spare
neither man, woman, nor child in the city; but
to let the very name of Bagdad be swept from
his dominions. Though this is not altogether
unlike the Sultan, I rather think it the report
of those within the city, to make the inhabitants
dread delivering it up into the hands of those
without. How blessed a portion is ours, in the
midst of all these perplexities, to stay ourselves
on our God, and to confide in the sympathizing
love of our Lord, who, worthless and vile as we
are, will not overlook us; but for his name&#8217;s sake,
will take care of the very hairs of our heads,
either in life or death. Amidst it all, what
chiefly troubles me is, that I love my Father and
my Lord so little, and that although there is not
an object in the world, but his service and glory,
for which I would desire to live; yet that, notwithstanding
this I live so little for it. Three
months have now passed since my dearest Mary
has entered into her rest, which I have spent
mostly in the sorrowful nursing of my poor dear
sinking babe, and though her love and preference
repays a hundred-fold all the trial, yet it pierces,
while it pleases the heart, to see that connection
so soon must cease. I often wonder at my strange
indifference to my situation, which, but for my
dear children, I think would be greater. I am
afraid to think it is the fruit of faith I feel, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
every other respect so weak; it seems more like
the physical insensibility of one who is without a
stake in what is passing. Oh, may my dear
Lord, in every earthly tie he breaks, bind my
poor soul doubly strong to himself for eternity,
and to his service while here.</p>

<p><em>Aug. 3.</em>&mdash;Some of the principal Christian families
sent to me to-day, to request me to subscribe
for guards to our quarter of the city, so that every
night we might have about 40 on guard. This I
saw my way clear in declining, believing that for
Christ&#8217;s servants the sword is not a lawful defence;
whatever it may be the Lord&#8217;s holy will I suffer,
let it not be in acting against my convictions of
his holy and blessed will, for though I feel as a
sheep in the midst of wolves, the Lord does not
allow my heart to be disturbed with any sense of
personal insecurity. How beautifully all our
blessed Lord&#8217;s precepts hang together, and fit
the one the other; if your consent to follow him in
his poverty as he has commanded, you have little
to fear in following his other commands of non-resistance:
if you accept not the first, you will
not accept the second, except in such circumstances
as expose you to perhaps little comparative
danger. May the Lord make me willing,
whatever it costs, to learn all his will, and give
me grace to love it. I have heard such instances
to-day of hateful and abominable oppression
and wickedness against the poor Christians,
by the followers of those who have the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
name of rulers within the city, that my heart
aches, and my soul loathes the place. But what
can we expect, when these very persons robbed
last night the house of Saleh Beg, himself from
whom they receive their pay.</p>

<p>A little butter and some sheep have been
brought into the city; but they ask so enormous
a price, that they have not yet been bought.</p>

<p>I was struck with the quickness with which
the mind apprehends the simple truth of God
when unprejudiced by interest. I have, without
even speaking contemptuously to the Christians
of their fasting, taken various opportunities of
expressing the liberty of a Christian to fast in
such a way, and at such times, as he believes
most conducive to his soul&#8217;s advantage; and
have pointed out to them, that to lay the stress
on it they do, was quite perverting the very
end and design of fasting; for that they are
manifestly less afraid of violating Christ&#8217;s commands
than their own regulations, which, as
they used them, were purely human. To-day,
a question arose between two of them in my
presence, about their fasts; and the one stated
as clearly as could be wished, the uselessness
of burthening their consciences about eating
a little butter instead of oil, or such like, instead
of seeking to flee from their lies, and drunkenness,
and robbery, and cheating. There seems
to me such a glorious moral power in God&#8217;s
word, that my heart never doubts of its producing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
marked effects, where it can be clearly
and fully delivered; but, oh, the language, what
a mountainous barrier!</p>

<p>Last night, whilst lying on my bed, on the roof
of my house, five balls passed over my head in
about as many seconds, so close, that I threw
myself off in expectation that the next might
hit it or me; at times I almost determined to
go down, but the danger of being shot did not
appear so dreadful as the suffocating heat down
stairs.</p>

<p><em>August 4.</em> <em>Thursday.</em>&mdash;We have received
accounts to-day of another messenger from
Bussorah, with letters for us, having been stripped.
How trying these dispensations are&mdash;how necessary
for our peace that our eye should only rest
on God, ordering in love every event concerning
us, even to the arrival of a letter, so that he
will allow nothing to fail us that is for our good.
I have to-day finished reading through again
Martyn&#8217;s Memoir, by Sargent. How my soul
admires and loves his zeal, self-denial, and devotion;
how brilliant, how transient his career;
what spiritual and mental power amidst bodily
weakness and disease. Oh, may I be encouraged
by his example to press on to a higher
mark. When I think of my own spiritual weakness,
contrasted with his spiritual power, it brings
a striking warning home to my heart to seek a
fuller and more abiding union with Jesus, from
whom alone flows the living waters that make
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
the branches fruitful; I am not now troubled
about that intellectual difference between us,
which might seem to make it impossible for me
to do what he did: the Lord has made me,
blessed be His holy name, contented in this
respect with any difference I may feel between
myself and his more exalted members; but my
sorrow is caused by my want of that likeness to
him, who is my Lord and King, which is alike
the common inheritance of all the members of
his mystical body. May I, however, henceforth
make the most of my talent, that I be not numbered
among the slothful servants at my dear
Lord&#8217;s most glorious and blessed appearing.
The mild seriousness that pervades dear H. M.&#8217;s
soul has for my heart a great charm. There is
not a trait of eccentricity&mdash;all is like his Lord
in its measure&mdash;he was solemn and serious as
became his work, yet full of zeal and affection,
which shewed itself, however, rather in the
steady power of a course of action than in expression.
It is astonishing what the world will
endure from a child of God, whose manner gives
them excuse for calling him an interesting eccentric
madman; because then all he says they feel
at liberty to laugh at; whereas, if the very same
truths were declared to them in the calm seriousness
of our Lord&#8217;s manner, it would make
them gnash on him with their teeth.</p>

<p><em>August 7.</em> <em>Lord&#8217;s day.</em>&mdash;This has been a
day of trials and tears. The visions of the night
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
were filled with her I have lost, and the day
has been spent in weeping over her, I am soon,
very soon, to lose; but this is only nature, my
soul rests happily in my Lord. I had given up
a little for his dear service! but he knew where
the heart&#8217;s reserves were, and has put his hand
on them; yet, blessed hope, that gilds these
darkest days&mdash;the day of the Lord is at hand,
when we shall meet to part no more. Oh,
may my heart live with this blessed vision ever
before it, and labour each day for the Lord,
as though it were to be the waking vision of
the morning&#8217;s dawn. My heart is very sad to
think how profitless a servant I have been;
but I do purpose, the Lord enabling me, to
be more diligent, more devoted in the future.</p>

<p>My mind has been much exercised with the
question of the desirableness of keeping a journal
of the soul&#8217;s inmost workings; but after reading
and thanking God for those of others, I feel I
never could write one without the fear of its
publication, and this would keep my soul in a
continual struggle, either by tempting me to say
too much or too little, more or less than the
truth; for, if any but my most gracious and
loving Lord knew me as I am, I should hide
myself for ever from the face of man. Yet
I pray the Lord, that he will by his Spirit
write a journal on my soul, that I may truly
feel how very meek and lowly it becomes
me to be when I think of all his forgiveness,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
notwithstanding my transgressions against him.
I feel there was something peculiarly gracious
in my Lord&#8217;s not sending me away to my sufferings
and trials, till he had given me a cordial,
in the assurance of his unchanging love. Oh,
but for this, what would my past trials have
been, had I not felt assured my Lord&#8217;s love did
not fluctuate with my feelings, nor depend upon
my worthiness. Oh, what a blessed passage is
that in Rom. v. &ldquo;If, when we were enemies,
we were reconciled to God by the death of his
Son, <em>much more</em> being reconciled we shall be
saved by his life.&rdquo; Yet the more I feel of this
assurance of such unmerited love, the more
hateful sin appears in all its shapes, and the
more my soul desires entire devotedness to the
whole will of God, and conformity to my gracious
Lord.</p>

<p><em>Aug. 9.</em>&mdash;A contest has sprung up between
the troops and the inhabitants of the city, in
which, from the continued firing, I should fear
there has been much slaughter. Our neighbours
are also again making barricades across
the street, near our door. I sometimes think
I am too impatient under these trials, instead
of being thankful for the mercies I enjoy, and
waiting without anxiety upon the Lord to work
as seemeth good to Him in his own time. I
hope to strive more and more after this childlike
confidence, which his experienced love so
richly deserves.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
I did not expect my sweet little baby would
have survived yesterday, yet she has this morning
a little revived.</p>

<p>In the hourly expectation of being plundered,
I have put such things as I should be sorry to
lose in a hole made in the wall, by the falling
of a room. Yet I trust I am quite content
the Lord should do as he sees best, even with
respect to these. I sometimes sigh to join my
dear Mary in the kingdom of peace and joy,
and be ever with the Lord. Oh, may the Lord
fully and quickly make me meet for the inheritance
of the saints in light.</p>

<p><em>Aug. 13.</em> <em>Saturday.</em>&mdash;The Arabs made an
attack on the other side of the town to-day,
but were repulsed. Another messenger from
Bussorah is arrived, but stripped and plundered
of our letters, and detained four days a prisoner
by the Arabs. He has been near a month
on his way. Bussorah, like Bagdad, is still
besieged.</p>

<p><em>Aug. 14.</em> <em>Sunday.</em>&mdash;My dear little baby and
some others of my patients have occupied much
of my time to-day; for though I give the people
generally to understand, that unless in cases
of necessity, I would rather see them on any
other day; yet, there are many whom I have
felt it to be my duty to see. The remainder of
the day, however, was rendered profitless by
extreme weariness, I having had to walk about
with my poor little withering flower several
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
hours through the night. I feel these trials all
arise in what appears to me my present plain path
of duty, so they do not greatly trouble me; though
the progress in the language is almost altogether
in abeyance; but, if I confine myself to my
Lord&#8217;s will, I feel he will manage all for me.</p>

<p>I have had with me to-day an Armenian gunsmith,
who has resided some years in Damascus;
he says, the Christians there are treated very
well, for though they will not allow them to
ride on horseback in the city, yet, as inhabitants,
they are well treated. He says, they are also
very numerous, inhabiting not less than 15,000
houses; but, if from this we deduct 10,000, we
shall probably be nearer the truth. The Jews
are not so well treated. From Shaum (Damascus)
to Beyraut, on the coast, is four days journey, to
Acre four, to Tripoli six, to Aleppo ten, and
the roads quite safe.  From Damascus to
Jerusalem is seven days journey, but through
an unsafe country. On the journey from this
place to Damascus, the only dangerous part of
the road is between this and Hit, on the
Euphrates, four days journey hence; after that
a certain sum is paid to the Arab tribes, you may
pass through. From Persian travellers, whom
they hate, they extort, when they know them,
a much greater sum, amounting sometimes to
from &pound;10. to &pound;20. between this and Damascus.
He says, you come to fresh water every second
or third day.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
<em>Aug. 19.</em> <em>Friday.</em>&mdash;Every thing seems darkening
in this wretched city. Numbers of poor
people are crying at the gates to be let out, that
they may not be starved in the city; but they
will not let them go. All the necessaries of life
have risen to five times their usual price, and the
pressure of this is increased tenfold by the time
at which it has occurred. The bricklayers, carpenters,
every trade has entirely ceased its occupations
in the city since the commencement of
the plague; so that all day-labourers, such as
weavers and others, are thrown out of their
employments, and without means of gaining their
bread. In addition to this, the Arabs are breaking
into every house where they expect to find
a little corn or rice, so that it is a difficult choice
either to be without provisions in danger of
starving, or of being broken in upon by such
ruffians, and stripped. We intend to bury a
little box, containing some rice, and flour, and
dates, under ground, that in the event of their
breaking in, we may yet secure food for a few
days, which may give us time to look about.
The Lord, however, is very gracious, and will
not try us above our strength, but will magnify
his grace even in these scenes of trial and distress.
The care of my dear little dying baby
has taken my mind much off from dwelling on
the distressing position in which we are, and,
for aught I at present see, are likely to continue
in, for those within the town feel it is their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
heads for which they are contending, and will
therefore hold out to the very last. Yet in
this whirlwind the Lord rides and reigns, and
no part of the mystical body of Christ, however
humble the member, will ever be forgotten: on
this we rest and wait for light and deliverance.</p>

<p><em>Aug. 23.</em> <em>Tuesday.</em>&mdash;Saturday last they made
a sally from the city against a tribe of Arabs,
friends of Ali Pasha, and after putting them to
flight, and killing 100, they cut off the heads
of 150 in cold blood afterwards. It appears
that the obnoxious parties within the city are
anxious to place the whole inhabitants of the
city on such terms with the assailants that they
shall fear the consequences of their entering the
town as much as themselves. They have allowed
about 5000 of the very poorest to leave the city,
but the enemy without will allow no more to
pass. A letter came yesterday to Mr. Swoboda
from a Bohemian, who is physician to
Ali Pasha, in which he desired to communicate
to all the Franks, that Ali Pasha had given
the strictest orders to his soldiers not to molest
one of them. To a certain extent this manifests
good intentions; but we have had too much
experience of the powerlessness of governors
at such times to restrain their soldiers, to have
much confidence in man: our confidence is in
Him who will and does watch over us for good.
From the daily increase in the price of provisions,
and the daily coining new lies to feed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the people with hopes instead of bread, I think
things cannot remain long in their present position;
yet the Lord knows. It is certain Bagdad
is altogether ruined; and if those who belong
to the neighbouring villages, and those who
would leave it, were there ever so small an
opening, were gone, the city would be a desert.</p>

<p>I had a patient with me to-day, who told me
that, out of a family of sixteen, he alone remains
from the plague. Persons he added, who before
these troubles were not worth a para, are seen
riding about on fine horses and trappings, covered
with gold and pearls, &amp;c.; and, on the other
hand, many who before were in very good
circumstances, are, by the robbery of those who
should protect them, reduced to beggary. It
appears that Ali Pasha is in want of nothing but
money and ammunition; and those within the town
want every thing but these. This wretched city has
suffered to an almost unparalleled extent the judgments
of God within the last six months: the
plague swept away more than two-thirds of its
inhabitants&mdash;the flood has thrown down nearly
two-thirds of its houses; and property and provisions
of corn, dates, sugar, &amp;c. &amp;c. beyond
all calculation, have been destroyed, and we are
now suffering under daily increasing famine, and
we have yet hanging over our heads the revengeful
sword of resisted authority, and the
unprincipled plunder of a lawless soldiery to
complete the devastation. This Pashalic was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
just about to fall an easy prey into the hands of
the Persians, who long to possess it, from their
famous place of pilgrimage, Kerbala, being in
the neighbourhood, and perhaps also to make up
for their losses on their Russian frontier. Thus
the Lord seems preparing these two great Mohammedan
powers for their final overthrow, partly
by the hands of each other, and partly by the
hands of the Christian power. In the province
of Kourdistan, the Persians have encroached
much on the territory of this Pashalic already.</p>

<p>Oh! how delightful it is to turn from these
scenes of present and prospective strife to that
happy approaching day, when the Lord shall
come with ten thousand of his saints to establish
his kingdom of peace and glory. Oh! may our
cry never cease to be, &ldquo;Come, Lord Jesus, come
quickly;&rdquo; and when he does come, may he find
us in his service among the faithful, chosen, and
true.</p>

<p><em>Aug. 24.</em> <em>Thursday.</em>&mdash;Three months and ten days
have now passed since the Lord took from me
her who was on earth the supreme consolation of
my life; and now, this day, he has taken from
me my sweet little baby without a sigh, without
the expression of pain during the whole of her
illness; for this my heart can, even at this moment,
bless the Lord; but it has left a void that
has more than ever made the world appear a
waste. The incessantly returning wants made
even these times appear to wing a rapid flight; but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
now all is still as death, except the weeping of
the poor nurse, who truly loved her, and watched
over her night and day with unremitting care.
Oh! what a time would these three months have
been for dear Mary, had she lived, and what
a day would this have been; but the Lord took
her from the evil to come, and has now taken the
dear little object of her love to her, to join her
little sainted sister and dear little brother; four
of us are gone, and three are left. May the Lord
quickly prepare us all, and hasten his coming
kingdom, that we may meet to part no more.
And, Oh! may he make and accept the remnant
of the worthless life he grants me, as a living
sacrifice to his service. Notwithstanding I acquiesce,
I trust, in the Lord&#8217;s will from the bottom
of my heart, yet I feel a desolation and loneliness
of heart, on this last dispensation, that surpasses
all I have felt in my last six months of trial. My
sweet little baby remained an object for those
affections to seize upon, which will exist while life
lasts, however disciplined, and however the power
of grace may prevail; but in one so weak in faith,
so earthly as I am, they have had much, too much
power, and therefore the Lord, in mercy to my
soul, has swept them all away, that I may have
nothing in this world left but his service. If this
be his holy purpose, may my whole soul second so
gracious an intention; and I pray the spiritual
family which the Lord, according to his promise,
has given me, fathers, mothers, sisters, and brothers,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
that their love and patience towards me
may abound, that my spirit may be refreshed
thereby, and my weakness encouraged to proceed&mdash;though
faint, yet pursuing.</p>

<p><em>Aug. 25.</em> <em>Friday.</em>&mdash;This day has taught me,
that if I would not be entirely miserable, I must
give up my whole time, and soul, and thoughts to
my Lord; for if I look off him, I feel bordering on
a gulf, the depth of which I cannot fathom. Oh!
may the Holy blessed Spirit give me such views of
the graciousness and exceeding riches of my Lord,
that I may really feel, that in having him, I have
all things. He alone is the same, yesterday, to-day,
and for ever. All created things, the nearest,
the dearest, the most beloved in the moment
of greatest need and greatest felicity, elude the
grasp, and flee away; but he abides always. I
desire, therefore, the Lord enabling me, to give
myself altogether to the preparation for my future
labours more diligently than I have ever
yet done; that though desolate on earth, I may
hold the freest and sweetest communion with
heaven; for of all preparation I feel the greatest,
the most needful to be, that of the heart; in order
to the constant sensible entertainment of Christ,
from whose nearness all the spiritual faculties
derive the sap and the fruit bearing strength.</p>

<p><em>Aug. 28.</em>&mdash;To-day I feel the Lord has given me
a victory, by turning my thoughts off my miserable
self and temporary circumstances, to the contemplation
of the happiness of those who are gone
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
before me, and by enabling me to feel set off on
my journey to meet them, and drawing every day
one day&#8217;s journey nearer, while I endeavour to
forget I had ever been happy in domestic life, or
ever possessed those dear objects; but nature was
often too strong for me, as I dwelt on their felicity,
and my journeying towards them daily, whether
the Lord brings them with him, or I go before he
comes. This hope does comfort me, for it is a
real abiding truth, whether I drink the sweets of
the consolation from it or not. I therefore now
purpose, the Lord enabling me, after nearly six
months interruption, to return to the studies preparatory
to my future duties as an itinerating missionary.
To this service I ever thought the Lord
had called me, and for this I now see all his trials
have been fitting me, for I am without a home
and without a tie in the world, but my dear Lord&#8217;s
service. These trials have made me ready for
entering on my work to any extent; as my dear
little boys will no longer confine me to one place,
but will soon be of an age to move about with
me; or should their choice render other arrangements
necessary, the Lord will open a way
for them likewise.</p>

<p>For an itinerating missionary on this side the
desert, three languages are essentially important;
Arabic, Turkish, and Persian: and this I feel,
unless the Lord very especially helps me, will be
<em>to me</em> no ordinary labour; but, as I am surrounded
by men who every day learn them for purposes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
of gain, I trust the Lord will not allow me to
faint, or be discouraged till, for his own service
I have attained them.</p>

<p>The internal state of the city is daily becoming
more and more critical: all the necessaries of life
are risen to ten times their common price, and are
even then with difficulty obtained. The abominations
that are now committed in the face of day,
makes the city appear ripe for the judgment of the
cities of the plain; and the poor Christians principally
suffer in the persons of their children in
these abominable acts of violence; but to seek a
remedy now is utterly useless, for all the power in
the city is in the hands of the lawless mob, who
are the perpetrators of all the wickedness. It
makes one&#8217;s heart ache to hear them weeping and
telling of their sufferings.</p>

<p><em>August 29.</em>&mdash;Last night some of the depredators
broke into our house, and have taken away
to the amount of about ten pounds from Kitto and
myself, while we were all asleep upon the roof of
the house, so there was nothing to hinder them
from clearing the house; yet the Lord some how
or other disturbed them, for though they took
my clothes out of a box, they dropped them in
their way to the window through which they entered,
and a box containing my money in my room
they never opened&mdash;in fact, it altogether appears
they went away without accomplishing the purpose
for which they came, and it so happened that
from the constant expectation of the general
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
plunder of the city, we had put away every thing
of any particular value. Should we be plundered
by the soldiers of Ali Pasha, we may possibly,
if our lives be spared, obtain, as Mr. Goodell
did, remuneration; but about this I do not feel
anxious: the Lord will provide.</p>

<p>From daylight this morning till near noon
there was a pretty sharp contest between those
within the city and those without, in which the
latter got the advantage. My feeling is, that
we are very fast approaching to a crisis, and in
that crisis our eyes are unto the everlasting hills&mdash;to
him who says, &lsquo;I will never leave thee nor
forsake thee,&rsquo; but who will be with us always even
unto the end of the world. Oh! what a relief
would a little time of peace and free communication
with our dear friends be. The latest letters
from England are dated nine months ago; and
from many, nay all my dear friends at Exeter, the
latest is nearly eleven months; so that all our trials
come together. For five months the dear little
boys have not set their foot without the door of
our house, and I cannot but feel it is a great mercy
of the Lord, that they are so happy and contented.
I have never heard, during all this time,
one word of complaint from them.</p>

<p><em>Aug. 30.</em>&mdash;The inhabitants are building up gates
in all the principal streets, both against the swarms
of thieves who plunder by night, and in anticipation
of the entrance of the opposing party,
when a general pillage seems now fully expected
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
by all. It often seems to me, on looking
around and seeing all without God, and trusting
to their puny efforts to avert impending evils,
what a blessed portion we have who know him,
believe in him, and love him, and know and feel,
that without his permission, not one hair of our
heads shall fall. Those within the city have
also again been out and attacked another tribe
of Arabs that were on Ali Pasha&#8217;s side, pillaged
and set fire to their camp, and brought the
plunder into the city, among which was a great
quantity of silk, which these Arabs had taken
from a caravan coming to Bagdad from Persia
in the time of the plague.</p>

<p><em>September 2.</em>&mdash;I was sent for to-day to see
the Pasha, who has, from the effects of a carbuncle
on his toe lost one of the joints, and
they have so treated it, that he will, I think,
now certainly lose another. He was particularly
kind and civil, and without any comparison, the
most gentlemanly person I have met with in the
East. There is an unaffected simplicity of manners,
and a benevolence of countenance, which
makes one wonder how all the accounts of his
actions, which we may, I think, say we know to
be true, could possibly be so. He made me a
present of three small cucumbers, at this time
the greatest rarity; and this may convey some
idea to what extent the privations of the poor
have gone, when the Pasha can hardly command
a cucumber, which, with legumenous fruits of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
similar kind, constitute a great portion of the
food of the poor in ordinary times. As I returned
from the Pasha a man levelled a gun at me, not
with any intention to fire I believe, but just to
show that independent boldness which fears no
one, but dares to do what it chooses.</p>

<p><em>September 6.</em>&mdash;There is nothing new; but the
uninterrupted stream of misery is still swelling
with its bitter waters: depredation and scarcity
increasing and advancing with pretty equal steps.
There seems to be signs of money beginning to
fail from the treasury of the Pasha, as his kanjaar
(a dagger), richly studded with diamonds,
was offered for sale the other day. The palace
of the Pasha, or rather its ruins, are filled with
Arnaouts, a mercenary band of soldiers, who employ
their time in making and drinking arrack,
and knocking down the walls of the palace,
wherever they yield a hollow sound, in search of
the hidden treasures of the Pasha. In these countries
it is a universal custom to bury or build up
in the walls of houses their treasures, from the
insecurity in which they always live.</p>

<p>Mr. Swoboda has received a letter from
a friend of his in the Pasha&#8217;s camp, stating
that there was a large pile of letters and
parcels for Europeans within the city, in the possession
of the Pasha. This is trying to us, but
still it brings the hope that we may yet soon receive
intelligence of our friends.</p>

<p>It seems as if the angel of destruction was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
resting on this city as on Babylon, to sweep it
from the earth. They are actually pulling down
the roofs of the bazaars to sell and burn the wood,
destroying buildings for fuel, that a hundred
times the worth of the wood will not replace, and
filling up the roads with rubbish so as to render
them scarcely passable. The state of anarchy
which prevails must be witnessed to be understood.
If it were not that the soul feels it
is the Lord&#8217;s province to bring order out of confusion
and good out of evil, it would utterly
despair in such a scene, where every element
at work seems wickedness; but amidst all, our
eyes are unto him.</p>

<p><em>September 7.</em>&mdash;Weak in body and mind, I
could sometimes almost impatiently wish for a
change. Yet the Lord is very gracious, and
suffers us to have quite enough for our health
and strength; and as for money, a Roman Catholic
merchant was with me yesterday, begging
that if I wanted any more, I would take it
from him, for they seem all to have that kind of
confidence even in our national character, that
they will generally without hesitation, let you
have money. For myself, I know not if my
mind preys on my body, or my body on my mind,
or whether they mutually act and re-act one on
the other; yet I feel on the whole thus much,
that if it appeared the Lord&#8217;s most gracious
pleasure to direct my steps away from this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
place for a season, I should be thankful. Nevertheless,
I desire to say from my heart, not my
will, O Lord, but thine be done. In Arabic, I
think I make daily progress, and I feel fully
assured, should the Lord spare my life for this
blessed work, that I shall one day be able to
preach the unsearchable riches of Christ intelligibly,
perhaps even fluently. Yet from the natural
badness of my memory, considerable time will
be requisite, unless the Lord vouchsafe to me
his especial help to this end, for which I daily
pray, for I want not opportunity but language to
preach Christ.</p>

<p><em>Sept. 9.</em> <em>Friday.</em>&mdash;Every thing continues still
increasing in price, and in an increased ratio
the sufferings of the poor: if they leave the city
they are stripped and driven back; if they remain
they are starved; and even the dates are
just come to an end, upon which for near three
weeks, both the people and the cattle have been
feeding. The Pasha has this day taken the
jewels of his wives to sell, from which and some
other signs, I am led to think his course is nearly
run, and that ere long he will follow the fate of his
predecessor. Ali Pasha told the Suffian-Effendi,
who went out to him to endeavour to accommodate
matters, that he had come for one head only, but
that after the way in which he had been treated,
he would not be satisfied with less than <em>ten</em>; and
if, at that time, which was nearly a month ago,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
he had determined to take ten, I fear a hundred
would not now satisfy him.</p>

<p>A poor Roman Catholic priest was with me
to-day, telling me of his distress, while one of
his opulent flock was sitting by him. He said
the Jews would not allow their poor to beg
from others; by which I thought he meant
to give a pretty intelligible hint that his flock
ought to be ashamed. But his rich hearer
only said, &ldquo;The Lord is merciful, and he will
provide.&rdquo; On this side the desert, the professing
Christians are not certainly priest-ridden
as they are in most Roman Catholic countries,
or even on the other side of the desert,
in consequence of there being no powerful
and wealthy communities like the monasteries
in Mount Lebanon, to bring down the
heavy arm of the Turks upon them; for without
the Turks they can do little, and these
petty governments joyfully interfere in their
strifes to extort money from both parties, though
in this respect, Bagdad has been better off than
most Pashalics for nearly sixty years past, since
the time of Suliman Pasha, whose slave the
present Pasha was, but liberated on his death.
Since him there have been Ali Pasha, Suliman
Pasha the younger, Abdallah Pasha, and Seyd
Pasha, all of whom have been murdered after
a longer or shorter period. Daoud Pasha has
now been fourteen years in possession of the
power he obtained by the murder of his predecessor,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
and seems now not far from sharing the
same fate.</p>

<p><em>Sept. 10.</em> <em>Saturday.</em>&mdash;The evening before
last the thieves broke into the house of one of
the sons of the Pasha, and killed three of the
servants: if they serve the Pasha so what have
others to expect? Instead of being surprised
that things are so bad, my surprise is that they
are not worse, seeing the city is entirely at the
mercy of those who are capable of every abomination
and cruelty; and there is no other restraint
upon them than what God puts into their hearts
by the undefined fear of possible retribution.
The most valuable articles known to belong to
the Pasha, from whom they had been stolen,
were sold openly in the streets, without the
least notice being taken, and thus also they
shoot individuals when they please, in the open
day and in the public thoroughfares, and no one
stops to see who it is or why it is, but every
one hastens off as fast as he can lest he should
share the same fate. And the passengers in the
streets are not only exposed to be shot at by
those prompted by deliberate enmity, but this
armed rabble is continually drunk, and, without
the least provocation, fire at men or women.
I seem to think, if it did please the Lord to
put an end to these scenes of sorrow and trial,
my heart would be very thankful; yet perhaps
in this I deceive myself, and all my gratitude
would be as a morning cloud. However, this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
I know, the Lord will not suffer me to be tried
above what he will enable me to bear, and on
this assurance, in the darkest day, may the blessed
Spirit enable my heart to repose. This is my
daily comfort.</p>

<p><em>Sept. 12.</em> <em>Monday.</em>&mdash;The poor are again permitted
to leave the city, and it is reported, that
when Ali Pasha heard that those had been
robbed who came out before, he threw some
of the supposed plunderers into the river, and cut
off the heads of others. However this may
be, 5 or 600 now daily go out and suffer no
molestation. This is a great mercy, for within
the city every article of food has disappeared
except buffaloes&#8217; and camels&#8217; flesh, and this
at about twenty times its usual price. Should
this state of things continue, it seems to me
from present appearances, that a general plunder
will be the consequence. To-day they have
pillaged the houses of some Jews. Yesterday
they broke open the house of Major Taylor&#8217;s
chaoush. They are very slow to interfere with
those under English protection; but when their
natural thievish propensities are stimulated by
want and opportunity, from what may they be
expected to withhold themselves?</p>

<p>Things within the city are now come to that
pass, that I heard from the Meidan to-day (the
place where the principal Turks reside) that
they have determined to wait five days more,
and if Ajeel, the Sheikh of the Montefeik Arabs,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
or some other efficient aid, does not arrive,
they will cut off the heads of Daoud Pasha and
Saleh Beg, who is his Kaimacam, or Lieutenant
Governor, and send them to Ali Pasha, for
the city can bear no more.</p>

<p>When I consider all the misery in the city,
and the privations not only among the poor,
but the rich, and consider how we have been
provided for, it does seem to me most marvellous,
strangers as we were, and without a friend.
Before the plague, in our ignorance of the
probable time of its continuance, and with the
certain knowledge that in the midst of the
greatest want, there was not a soul that could
help us, we took in enough of wheat, rice, soap,
and candles, to last till within a very few weeks.
When dear Mr. Pfander left us, we made him
some sausages, called in this country <em>pastourma</em>:
he, however, took but a few, and the rest remained
with us, and served us both during the
plague, and now in the famine to vary our food
a little, though somewhat dry and as hard as
wood, and still of them one or two remains. The
dear boys also had some pigeons: these also
served us for many days. We then had two
goats for my poor dear little baby, and to give
us milk; but provisions became so dear that
we were obliged to kill one; this we divided
among the poor: the second at last we also
killed, and potted in its fat. This by little and
little we are consuming. We have also got four
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
or five hens, which lay two or three eggs a-day.
Thus the Lord has provided for us till now; and
if we have not had abundance, we have never
suffered from want. And now, when wheat and
rice is not to be bought, and if possessed in
quantities would expose the possessors to inevitable
pillage, the Lord has so graciously
supplied us, that we avoid both want and the
danger of possessing provisions in the house, for
before the kind Taylors left this, they gave me
permission to take from the Residency whatever
I might want, and this I now take by little and
little as I need, and the house of the Resident
is so far respected in public opinion, that openly
disorganized as things are, I do not think they
will commit any violence upon it.</p>

<p>I am sure there are many who, in reading
this, will bless God for his goodness to us, so
utterly unworthy as we are; but, oh! if they
could be witnesses of the misery that others
suffer, and from which his mercies have freed
us, they would indeed praise him. For, even
when provisions were to be had, had we been
obliged to purchase at the price things then were
and are now, we must inevitably have run in
debt; but as it is we have enough of money
for more than a month to come. Therefore,
bereaved and incapable as I yet feel of all enjoyment,
I desire to bless the Lord for all his
great goodness and care over us, of the least
of whose mercies I feel infinitely unworthy.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
And though my faith does not enable me fully
now to feel, in unison with my <em>soul&#8217;s judgment</em>,
on my heavenly Father&#8217;s dealings toward me,
when time has removed the bitter cup farther
distant, it may not possess all its present intensity
of bitterness, to which also so many circumstances
have tended to add additional pungency&mdash;not
a friend near, not a communication
from any of those far away. I have ever felt one
abiding source of comfort, in that I knew I enjoyed
the prayers of many whose prayers I truly
value, and through these I believe I shall yet
stand complete in all the will of God, to remove
or to remain, to live or to die. The Lord will
quickly come, and then his power and great glory
will be manifested to the joy of his chosen and the
confusion of his enemies.</p>

<p><em>Sept. 14.</em> <em>Wednesday.</em>&mdash;While I feel more convinced
every day that a missionary in these countries,
who really would cast himself upon his
Lord, and share in its revolutions and national
judgments, has more to prepare his mind for them
previously to his entering upon it than he can
well conceive: yet on the other hand, I feel more
confirmed in the opinion, that amidst this disjointed
disorganized state of society, there are
more doors of irregular missionary service open
than he can possibly occupy. For though he can
perhaps find few opportunities of publicly preaching
Christ; yet in conversation, and the preparation
and circulation of tracts, I think there are immense
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
opportunities afforded. Yet for conversation
much time will be required in acquiring
a facility in the language by most, till the Lord
is pleased to pour down from on high, his gifts of
the Spirit&mdash;and as to tracts, at present we have
none. The Turkish Armenian tracts, printed at
Malta, are not clearly understood here; neither
do I think the Arabic or Turkish spoken on the
other side of the desert would be so either, if I
may judge from the translations into Turkish and
Arabic. In fact, it would appear desirable if
the object of a missionary be to labour in the east,
that he should study on this side the desert if
possible; though the difficulties of a family are
great here amidst the constant succeeding commotion
of this disturbed country. There is no
retiring place within at least some hundred miles,
at all times by a dangerous journey, but in such
times as these almost impassable. And the elements
of disorder do not arise only from the state
of the Ottoman empire, but from the vicinity of
Persia, daily encroaching on this side, as I have
mentioned before, both from religious and political
motives, and this spirit is encouraged by
the constant weakening of the pashalic. About
fifty or sixty years ago, commenced the government
of Suliman Pasha the elder, who
continued twenty-three years in his situation
and died in his bed. This Pasha raised Bagdad
from a place of little mercantile consideration
to be one of the most important places of traffic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
in the east, and he allured merchants from all
parts by the equity and firmness of his government.
From that to the present time, this pre-eminence
has been enjoyed by Bagdad, and it
has been the central place of trade between the
east and the west; and for these purposes, if improved,
a more desirable situation could not
be imagined under a firm and wise administration.
This Suliman Pasha strengthened the Georgian
interest in this pashalic prodigiously by the
purchasing of an immense number of Georgian
slaves whom he manumitted at his death. One of
these, Ali Pasha, who married his daughter,
succeeded him, and was murdered at prayers
after about five years reign. Suliman Pasha
who succeeded him, also married a daughter of
the former Suliman, he governed about three
years, and was then put to death. He was succeeded
by Abdallah Pasha, who was the treasurer
of Ali Pasha; he continued about three
years, and was put to death. To him succeeded
Seyd Pasha, son of Suliman Pasha the elder,
who, at the end of about three years, was
also put to death. To these last who had thus
succeeded and murdered one another, succeeded
Daoud, the present Pasha, who to avoid a like
fate with his predecessors, cut off every man
about him who could possibly afford him any umbrage;
but while on the one hand he secured
himself, on the other he so weakened the
Georgian interest, that when his affairs became
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
involved in difficulty, there was none to help but
creatures who had ministered to his avarice which
he had gratified at the expence of every loyal
feeling (if such an expression can be used by a
Turk.) But still, though previous to the plague,
the Georgians had been thus diminishing in
numbers, and more so in intellectual and moral
character, still they were a strong body; but the
plague swept them nearly all away. All this
taking place at this peculiar juncture when there
is no recruiting their strength from Georgia,
which is now in the hands of the Russians, and
when the heart of the Sultan is peculiarly set
against the whole mameluke rule seems to indicate
the period of their downfall to be near at
hand. Should Ali Pasha now succeed in getting
possession of the city, the Georgian government
of these renegade slaves will be ended as that of
their brethren in apostacy was in Egypt. But,
however things may terminate, there are no
elements of recovery, fall they must; for the
curse of God is upon them from the hands of one
tyrant after another, till some powerful nominal
Christian government will accept the government
of them, for which they are daily ripening,
which they are daily expecting, and which will
finally happen, unless they fully adopt a European
policy and plan, and this by another
road, will lead to the same end, the overthrow
of Mohammedanism and the establishment of infidelity.
I have just thus cursorily made these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
remarks, that no missionary may deceive himself
by expecting any long period of peace and
quietness. If it comes, he may bless God; but
if it be withheld, he must calculate upon it.
And I think those who are lightly armed for
their work&mdash;who can run, and fly, and hide, and
at all events have only their own lives to care
about, will be happiest amidst all their privations
and trials between Bagdad and China. But for
those who have known the endearment of domestic
life, or who are by nature peculiarly susceptible
of its happiness it may truly be said, this is
a living martyrdom. It is: but it is <em>for Christ</em>,
who will soon come and wipe away all tears
from our eyes. I desire daily to feel it is a world
in which my gracious Lord was an outcast, and
where it would be to my loss if I made me a
home. May the Lord make me willing to serve
him on these or any other terms he may manifest
at his pleasure.</p>

<p>This morning some persons who were employed
for the purpose, set at liberty two of the principal
Georgians who were imprisoned in the
camp of Ali Pasha.</p>

<p>The Armenian servant to whom I lent an Armenian
Testament, with the translation into the
modern Constantinople dialect, came to me to
say how much better he understood it than he did
before in the old language, and his countenance
seemed quite to brighten up at the sense of his
attainment.  Among the Armenians I think
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
there is an open door, especially among the young,
their ears are open and thirsting for information
on every subject.</p>

<p>The father of the Armenian schoolmaster was
to-day speaking with me on the difficulty of that
passage, &ldquo;Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I
hated.&rdquo; He said he felt just in that state as though
God had said to him, I will not receive you. I
longed to preach to him fully so far as I am able,
Him who saith, Whosoever cometh to me I will
in no wise cast out; but I have many difficulties:
he is very deaf, and Armenian and Turkish, not
Arabic, are the languages he understands. The
languages greatly try me, for though I feel by the
Lord&#8217;s mercy making daily progress, yet still I
feel four or five years must pass before I am fully
prepared even in this department of my labour,
and happy shall I be if in that time it be accomplished.</p>

<p><em>Sept. 15.</em> <em>Thursday.</em>&mdash;After a night of anxious
suspense, the day has dawned in comparative
peace; the cry that Ali Pasha&#8217;s troops were entering
the city, began soon after we had retired
to rest, and continued till near morning. Now
we hear that Daoud Pasha had fled from the
house of Saleh Beg during the night and endeavoured
to enter the citadel, but the soldiers would
not admit him. He is now in the hands of the people
of the Meidan. The Chaoush Kiahya of Ali
Pasha has entered the city, and every one is in
an awful state of suspense as to the future fate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
of the inhabitants, at least of the higher classes.
I have just set up the English flag that they may
know the inhabitant of the house is a stranger
here, who has nothing to do with the strife of the
city. If, after this, the Lord allows them to
enter our habitation, may his holy and blessed
will be done. I think the Lord has allowed my
mind to be in perfect peace as to the result.</p>

<p>The poor wives of the Pasha are kissing the
hands of passers by, begging that they will give
them an asylum. Poor sufferers! all are afraid to
interfere so as to afford them that which they want.
At present, words and appearances are peaceable.
May the Lord of his mercy grant that they may
continue so.</p>

<p>To-day we killed two fowls to have a little fresh
meat. Thus the Lord has kept us through all this
time of trial, and we have enough remaining for
five or six days, blessed be his holy name. This
day has ended in perfect peace, not a disturbance
or an individual molested. The principal thieves,
who, at the head of various gangs, were robbing
the city in every direction, are now doing all they
can to escape, for they are perfectly known. Thus
the gracious hand of the Lord has removed in
one day the siege and famine, and fear and terror,
from the lawless within, and the undefined terrors
from those who are without, so that all seems joy
and gladness to the poor inhabitants. In the conclusion
of this affair Ali Pasha has conducted himself
amidst numberless provocations with a moderation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
and prudence that does him the highest honour;
bless the Lord for all his mercies. This will
be the first night for months that we shall retire to
rest without the hateful sounds of civil strife saluting
our ears, or disturbing our rest.</p>

<p><em>Sept. 16.</em> <em>Friday.</em>&mdash;Another peaceful day. Ali
Pasha has collected all the principal Georgians together
in his camp. When the late Pasha went out
to his camp, he rose from his seat and embraced
him, and told him not to fear; that the Sultan had
ordered his life to be spared; to Saleh Beg also
assurances of safety were given, and in fact up to
this time not one individual has been put to death.
It remains yet to be seen whether this be a cloak or
real moderation. However, from the great body
of the citizens all fear is removed, and both animals
and inhabitants alike rejoice in returning abundance.
The wheat that was sold on Wednesday,
for 250 piasters, was sold on Thursday for 40, and
other things in proportion, besides which, vegetables
have re-appeared, which, for five months,
were not to be procured, at any price.</p>

<p>I sent out to-day the chaoush of Major Taylor
to Ali Pasha, to enquire if there were any letters
or packets for the Residency or for me; but I
found there were none to my great disappointment.
However, Ali Pasha was very civil; enquired
after the Resident, hoped there would be
perpetual and increasing affection between them,
&amp;c. &amp;c. We have now to wait to see how these
fair beginnings will end. I have just seen the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
Hakeem Bashee or chief Physician of Ali Pasha,
who is an Italian, and to my great joy found he
had locked up in his box for me many letters and
newspapers, which he from time to time collected
in the camp; whenever any messenger was brought
in, and his packets examined, all that were for
Europeans he took out, and put in his box; to-morrow
he promises to let me have those that were
addressed to me. He tells me that Ali Pasha has
two interpreters, natives of Cyprus, who speak
Turkish, Italian, and Romaic. It appears that
a great change is contemplated in the government
of this Pashalic.</p>

<p>One of the two gentlemen whom Major Taylor
sent to examine the Euphrates from Beles to Anah,
has arrived at Aleppo on his way to Beles. From
Anah to Bussorah there is no insurmountable impediment
in the way of steam navigation. The
part that now remains to be examined is from Beer
to Anah.</p>

<p><em>Sept. 18.</em> <em>Lord&#8217;s day.</em>&mdash;To-day I have received
a long missing letter from the dear Taylors, in
which Major Taylor most kindly and generously
offers, should any thing happen to me, to consider
my dear boys as his own, till he has an opportunity
of sending them safely to the hands of their friends
in England. Thus the Lord provides, thus he
orders for us. This kind offer of Major T. was
quite unsolicited, for, though when I felt attacked
by the plague, I had written a letter making this
request, yet, on my recovery, I destroyed it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
I also received a letter from Dr. Morrison, in
China, in which he expresses his conviction of the
importance of missionaries learning to earn their
subsistence by some occupation, however humble,
rather than be dependant as they now are, on
societies. I confess my mind so far entirely agrees
with him, that, if I had to prepare for a missionary
course, I would not go to a college or an institution,
but learn medicine, or go to a blacksmith&#8217;s,
watchmaker&#8217;s, or carpenter&#8217;s shop, and there pursue
my preparatory studies. I do not mean to
say, that this should be to the exclusion of preparatory
studies in language, and the deepest preparatory
Scripture studies, but, in conjunction
with them, for I am satisfied it is a much greater
blessing to missionaries to lead those down who
either by birth or other circumstances may have
been a little removed from the lower orders of society
than to raise those of humble birth to the rank
of gentlemen in the world, who neither by education,
habits, nor intercourse are enabled happily or
profitably to fill such a station&mdash;but it is that yoke
of mere human ordination, the necessity of a
<em>title from man to preach</em> and <em>administer</em> as it is
called the sacraments, of which not so much as
a hint is contained in the New Testament, it is that
awful distinction between laity and clergy which
are the things that tie up all hands, and put bodies
of men into situations of trial, who, but for this
delusion, would be without any comparative difficulties.
Without these we should learn to judge of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
men&#8217;s fitness for their work, not by their being ordained
or unordained by this or that denomination
of men, but according to the rule of the apostles,
by their doctrine and walking as they had them
for &ldquo;ensamples;&rdquo; if they came otherwise, though
apostles or angels, let them, says the apostle,
be accursed. Oh, if this principle of the apostles
were set up in proving all things and holding fast
that which is good, we should not hear so good a
man, and one so much to be loved, as Mr. Bickersteth,
misleading his readers by telling them to adhere
to an unsound <em>authorised</em><a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
teacher, rather
than go to a sound and unauthorised one; to one
who is authorised by the head of the church, though
not by the head of the state. So said not Paul,
but, &ldquo;if I or an angel come preaching any other
doctrine, let him be accursed.&rdquo; In all the Apostle
Paul&#8217;s trials with the false teachers, and in all the
directions given respecting them to the various
churches, he never once alludes to their appointment
by the apostles or any other human being, or bodies
of human beings, as even a collateral ground of consideration
and preference, but always to the truth,
the truth, the truth; if they preach that, well;
if they do not, it matters not who they are, nor
whence they came, from heaven or earth, they
are to be rejected. God grant the day may quickly
come when the church of God may care as little
about the opinions of bishops and presbyteries or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
any other association of men, <em>apart from their
piety and truth</em>, as the Lord and his Apostles
cared about the opinions of the Sanhedrim. So
far as their estate or authority is temporal, let us
obey them, but let us keep our souls free.</p>

<p>It is said that all these provinces, from Bussorah
to Bagdad, Sulemania, Mosul, Diarbekr, Merdin,
Orfa, and Aleppo, are to be under the government
of Ali Pasha; at all events there seems
to be such a change contemplated, that at present
I do not see it right to remove, especially as the
Lord has provided an asylum in the event of any
thing happening to me, in the bosom of Mr.
Taylor&#8217;s family, for my dear boys.</p>

<p>Under Daoud Pasha the people were oppressed
by monopolies in every article of consumption.
Ali Pasha seems determined to put an end to the
system. The cryer yesterday proclaimed that
meat was to be sold for no more than two piasters
an oke,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
and that if any man took more he
should be hanged on the spot to his own crooks.
One of the butchers, near the Meidan, who was
detected yesterday, selling meat for three piasters,
was instantly hanged. After which, the butchers
went to the officer who superintends their affairs,
and offered him considerable sums of money as a
bribe, but he would pay no attention to them.</p>

<p><em>Sept. 21.</em> <em>Wednesday.</em>&mdash;Nothing can exceed
the attention and respect that is paid to Daoud
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
by Ali Pasha; for his life, he said, he had nothing
to fear; the Sultan had pardoned him, and a firman
had come to that effect, but that the Sultan
wished him to go to Constantinople on the morrow
or the day after. Therefore he leaves
this, and his wives go with him, and his eldest
son, Hassan Beg, who has had all his property
made him a present of by Ali Pasha, and every
thing they choose to select for the convenience of
the journey, is to be provided for them. There is
something in this treatment so utterly unlike any
thing that has been ever witnessed before, that
people know not what to make of it; the Turks
cannot be brought to believe but that there must
be some treachery under it; for my own part, I
do believe that so far as Ali Pasha is concerned,
this is not true.</p>

<p>The Turks here are also much startled at seeing
their long robes and turbans thrown away for an
European military uniform, with epaulets and
other decorations; and they say that Ali Pasha
himself has quite adopted the European dress, so
what changes we may expect I know not, but
certainly great ones are contemplated; any change
approximating to this has not been introduced from
the days of the Patriarchs till now. Drinking is no
longer a covert offence that they practice in secret;
but wine and spirits are brought in their trays as
regular articles of consumption. The fact is, that
Mohammedanism and Popery have received, and
are receiving, such hard knocks that their power
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
will certainly sink, even though the name may remain,
and I do expect that this state of powerlessness
in these two bodies will open ways for God&#8217;s
elect among them to come out.</p>

<p>I had yesterday a long and most interesting conversation
with a very respectable Armenian Roman
Catholic merchant of this place, most timidly fearful
of having his faith touched; yet the Lord opened
the way to the introduction of the conversation on
some very interesting topics&mdash;on the duty of reading
God&#8217;s word for ourselves, and on the worship
of the Virgin, on all of which, little by little, he
conversed freely.&mdash;He seemed well acquainted with
the Scriptures I quoted, but had never thought
about the questions, and this is the great preparatory
work in this country, to get men to think on
the things of the soul&#8217;s everlasting interests, and
to feel that these things have to do with the various
relations of life. In all countries custom has much
power; but in the East it is despotic.</p>

<p>I have been much struck in reading some letters
in the Record, on the Church and Dissent, which
has made me feel the necessity and value of
that word of our blessed Lord.&mdash;&ldquo;If thine
eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of
light.&rdquo; Surely if the Scripture be sufficient to decide
any question, it is sufficient to decide the
question of what a child of God ought to do when
a man, calling himself a minister of Christ, propagates
errors among any section of Christ&#8217;s church.
Does not Paul say, Who is Paul or Apollos, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
ministers by whom ye believe? What, then, is
the Church of England, or Scotland, or the Dissenters,
but various ministries, by which we believe?
And the same apostle&mdash;the exalter of the
Lord of life, and the abaser of every high thought
of man, says, &ldquo;If I or an angel from heaven
preach any other gospel than that you have received,
let him be accursed.&rdquo; Does Paul set up
the principle that men are to be received not according
to the truth or error of their doctrine, but
according to the sect to which they belong, or the
mode or circumstance of ordination? Never: but
the very reverse. With the apostle it is always
the truth&mdash;the truth&mdash;the truth; let those judge
who wish to see.</p>

<p>Now, I will just state a strong case, but a fact.
I was one day travelling in the mail, and a certain
person in one corner began a most obscene conversation,
with a gentleman who came to see him at
the door of the mail, while it was changing horses.
Opposite him, in the other corner, was his own
son. When the mail arrived at the place to which
we were going, on getting out, I asked the people
at the coach office, who that person was. I had
previously considered him as an officer in the army,
but, to my amazement, was told he was the Rev.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;.
This individual has since been made a
dignitary of the Church of England, and has had
other preferment bestowed upon him; and this is
but part of what might be said. You will say this
is an extreme case. But it is a matter of fact.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Am I to remain under the ministry of such a
teacher? It not only shocks the affections of a
child of God, but the very common sense of the
world, and, if our eyes were single, it would, in
proportion strike us till we should come down to
the apostle&#8217;s rule, about receiving teachers&mdash;those
who preach the truth, and walk as ye have us for
an ensample.</p>

<p>As to example on which so much stress is laid,
what example does a man give to his children or
neighbourhood, when he continues to sit under the
ministry of one whom he believes to be not a
preacher but a perverter of the truth? Why,
that the Church of England and its forms, even in
the midst of our unfaithful ministry, is dearer to
him than Christ&#8217;s Church and his truth, under less
agreeable external circumstances. On the other
hand, what example does he give if he quit this,
which may be granted on all hands to be an unsound
ministry, for a sound one? Why, that he
loves Christ&#8217;s Church and truth so much better
than any circumstances, that though it may cost
him pain and sorrow he leaves the one for the other.</p>

<p>There seems an idea prevalent, and kept up in
all these letters, which is in fact most untrue&mdash;that
a man, by leaving the
church<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
becomes a dissenter
in principle. Whereas I think many who have
merely followed the line which the apostle recommends,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
of turning away from false teachers, are not
at all thereby rendered in love with dissent as one
system set up against another system. It appears
to me, that a sectarian Church of England-man,
and a sectarian Dissenter, whose only desire is to
see augmented the respective members of those
who follow them, are equally removed from the
mind of Christ. The thing devoutly to be prayed
for, for them all is, that when they respectively
approach the nearest to the meaning of the divine
word and the mind of Christ, they might be respectively
strengthened and made willing in those
things to borrow from each other, and all sides to
remember that that love which covereth many
faults is more valuable a thousand times than that
sectarian zeal that magnifies every weakness and
infirmity into a mortal sin, and which delights in evil
surmisings and evil speakings.</p>

<p>The term which passes current with so many
who are attached to the Church of England exclusively
of &ldquo;our apostolic church,&rdquo; it may not be
amiss for a moment to dwell on. Where then
does this apostolic similarity dwell, and in what
does it consist?</p>

<p>Is it in the mode of appointment of Bishops?
<em>Formerly</em> it was the work of the church, with
which the state had nothing to do. <em>Now</em>, it
may be the work of an infidel ministry, for infidel
purposes.</p>

<p>Is it the state and pomp of the episcopacy, the
titles&mdash;&ldquo;Your Grace,&rdquo; &ldquo;Your Lordship,&rdquo; your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
palaces, your carriages, and fame, and hosts of
idle livery servants?</p>

<p>Is it in the mode of appointment to the cure of
souls? <em>Then</em> it was in the choice of the church; or,
if of new churches, the appointment of those who
had gathered them. <em>Now</em>, this cure is publicly sold
like cattle in the market to the highest bidder,
and a large proportion of the remainder may be in
the hands of an infidel Lord Chancellor, to give as
he pleases.</p>

<p>Is it the Liturgy? However valuable it may be,
no one will pretend to say the apostles used one.</p>

<p>And even in the places of public worship, their
grandeur, or their neatness, or their convenience are
equally unlike the places of meeting of the apostles,
who were happy to assemble in an upper loft. Instead,
therefore, of saying the Church of England is <em>Apostolic</em>,
it is infinitely more true to say she is <em>Romish</em>, in
all those things on the distinction of which she prides
herself and becomes distinguished. And the broad
line of distinction between her and the apostate mother
of harlots, commences when she comes to those
points, whereon all the churches of Christ agree&mdash;the
doctrines she professes, and which are to a
very great extent scriptural and pure; and may
the Lord water her truth while he sweeps away
her dross and tin. Believing, as I do, her connection
with the state to be an unmitigated evil as
it relates to her spiritual power, I cannot but rejoice
that this false ground of confidence and support
which has made toryism stand too often in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
place of truth and piety, as a recommendation to
her highest places of trust, is crumbling underneath
her, only her bonds will be burnt in the fire.
May she have the holy wisdom to strengthen what
remains, that when the times of her dominion shall
pass by, the time of her spiritual splendour may
return. In short, though there be much that is
intolerable in the Church of England, much may
be modified, and may yet, possibly, remain; but
this is clear, that that swelling of the bosom which
distinguishes a true son of the Church of England,
considered as a sectarian, when he enunciates the
term of &ldquo;Our Apostolic Church,&rdquo; if it refers to
discipline as well as doctrine, and external circumstances
as well as internal principles, is the
merest delusion that ever was published, and the
most unsubstantial vision that ever formed the
basis of pride, and one that will now remain unmasked
no longer. May the Lord grant her
grace in her day of trial, to run into her real ark
of strength&mdash;the truth of God. What is contrary
to God&#8217;s will in her, may he make her ready, nay,
anxious to throw off, as an incubus that oppresses
her. What is not contrary, yet not essential,
may she hold with that degree of tenacity
only which such things deserve, and remain alone
valiant for the truth on the earth.</p>

<p>Many will say this is written by the hand of an
enemy. But I protest before Him whom I love
and serve, however unworthily, that I love the
Church of Christ in the midst of her, fervently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
desiring their spiritual pre-eminence, and praying
for her prosperity.</p>

<p>The detestable association between the Dissenters,
considered as a body, and the calumniators
and degraders of the Lord of life, for the beggarly
purposes of this world&#8217;s power, sufficiently prove
to my mind, that a spirit, which is not of God&#8217;s
children, rests among them too extensively somewhere,
as I have before mentioned; and even the
true children among them, who have been drawn
into such an ungodly coalition, show great spiritual
weakness. In the word of God I see Christ exalted
and his truth; and not churches, apostles, or
prophets; all things are to be proved, and that
which is good to be kept. Apostles are to be
tried, and if found <em>liars</em>, to be rejected.
Think you, when the church of Ephesus, in the
Apocalypse is commended by our Lord, for trying
those who said they were apostles and were not,
and when she had found them liars, that her
members for example, still sat under their ministry.
What a strange perversity of judgment prejudice
casts over the mind. I cannot imagine any holier
more acceptable service to our dear and blessed
Lord and master, than that of endeavouring to
unite in true and holy union, all the real members
of his now (as to external circumstances) painfully
divided body, for the Lord enables me to feel and
to know, that amidst all the divisions and hard
names that prevail among the members, there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
does really exist a body bound together for eternity,
in all the essentials of Divine truth.</p>

<p><em>Sept. 24.</em>&mdash;Nothing of any striking moment
relative to our situation has occurred since the
last date: all is quiet. Yet circumstances have
taken place of the deepest interest, which makes
my soul rejoice in God. In a packet of letters, I
received the other day from India and Bussorah,
was one from a person whom I met here, a gay
thoughtless officer in the army, who seems now
really seeking for light and life. Of this I am
sure, that with that soul, it never can be again as
in times past; the name of Christ will either be a
savour of life unto life, or of death unto death. Oh!
how strange a thing here does a consciousness of
divine life in the soul appear, and how affecting is
it to receive that news fresh from the heart of one
who has seen, in spiritual things, men as trees
walking. May the Lord complete what he has begun,
and make his recovered child a burning and
a shining light in that land of darkness, where
he sojourns. This intelligence comes too at a
very acceptable time, for I have had a slight
attack of fever for these last ten days, which,
though it is not worth mentioning, has, like all
fevers, left me weak, and with a tendency to depression.
Nor is this all the good the Lord has
done me. The Roman Catholic merchant whom
I mentioned before, has been again with me.
He told me, that when I came from England I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
brought a letter for him, which is true, from a
very dear friend, in which he was requested to
come every day to see me, and talk with me, for I
was neither a Roman Catholic, a Greek, an Armenian,
nor belonging to any other denomination, but
a Christian. He, however, never came. Shortly
after my arrival I met him at the house of another
merchant, and as I could not talk with him, my
dear brother Pfander did; but nothing could exceed
the timid reserve and coldness with which he
answered all questions respecting religion. But yesterday
he told me, &ldquo;Now I do not fear to converse
with you.&rdquo; Surely here is something gained. May
the Lord grant me grace to pour in the sincere
milk of the word. At present I see nothing more
than a willingness to hear and consider; but this
is almost like finding a spring in the desert, when
you are parched with thirst.</p>

<p>I have also received from Mr. Brandram, the
Secretary of the Bible Society, a kind and generous
letter from that noble institution, which enables
me to enter on their work with all my heart,
leaving the question of money free, and only seeking
the soul&#8217;s profit of those on whom their benefits
are bestowed: if I obtain money, well&mdash;if not, I
am only to seek a fair guarantee that the people
will read and take care of the books I have without
money full liberty to give. These books are
arrived at Bussorah, so that when they reach me,
what with those I already have, and those coming
from Constantinople or Smyrna, I shall have quite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
a depository. All these circumstances at present
make me determine to stay here, the Lord enabling
me, though we again hear that the Persians are at
Sulemania. I was lately informed that Capt.
Chesney, with a gentleman from Bombay, and his
wife, had endeavoured to pass on to Shiraz from
Bushire; but that they were not allowed to enter
that place. They next tried by Shuster, but from
hence likewise they were obliged to turn back.
They appear to have made a third trial with more
success; but an Armenian, who was with me the
other day, said he saw them at Ispahan stripped of
every thing they had, and obliged to borrow money
for their journey, which, as I have before observed,
the English always obtain without the least difficulty.</p>

<p><em>October 9.</em> <em>Lord&#8217;s Day.</em>&mdash;It is just one fortnight
since the Lord has laid me on the bed of
sickness and suffering; for nearly a fortnight previous
an attack of typhus fever had been making
its steady advances. I had lost all appetite,
strength, and ability to sleep, accompanied by
that strange overwhelming depression of mind that
inclines one to weep one knows not why. But this
day fortnight I was completely laid by, and this
is the first day I have had my clothes on since.</p>

<p><em>Oct. 11.</em>&mdash;The Lord still allows me to feel convalescent,
and I cannot but think of his mercies
to me in my solitary and lonely situation, with all
these tendencies to depression, which are concomitants
of the disease. He sent me from time to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
time such cheering intelligence, as enabled me to
hope his cause would prosper, and that all
these turmoils were only the more speedily preparing
the way for it. I certainly now close this
journal with more of hope than I have been led
to entertain for many months, yet not without
some fears.</p>

<p>The few Georgians that remained from the
plague have been nearly all put to death, so that
the Georgian government of Bagdad is, as I anticipated,
now extinguished. The elements of
disorder and weakness are so interwoven in this
wretched government, that it will require a measure
of energy and wisdom not often found united,
to establish a better order of things; but I desire
to leave all in the Lord&#8217;s hands. I shall here
then conclude my journal for the present, and
most humbly and heartily pray, that all the trials,
public and private, recorded in it, may redound to
the glory of him who is the Lord of lords, and
King of kings; and that my soul may not lose its
portion of profit.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>I had thought of finishing my journal for the
present, but as it has been delayed going for want
of an opportunity, I add the following.</p>

<p><em>Oct. 14.</em>&mdash;All in the city is quiet yet. There is
no apparent confidence: men seem waiting to see
how things will turn out. Every thing is very
dear, as it must necessarily be for some time.
The greatest part of the inhabitants are dead, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
many of the survivors have become rich, either by
the death of relations or by robbery, and no one
will do any thing without an exorbitant remuneration.
I have just had a quantity of rice cleaned,
for doing which, previously to the plague I gave a
piastre and a half, and now I have given six
piastres.</p>

<p>We have an Armenian bishop coming here in
the room of the priests who are dead. I know not
what his plan of operation will be; but the Lord
is on our side.</p>

<p>I had a visit yesterday from the Abb&eacute; Troche,
who has the superintendence of the Catholic
mission here; he was very pleasant; but nothing
particular passed, as many others were present.
My conversations with the Roman Catholic merchant
I have before mentioned, are still very open
and free. Oh! may the Lord water and bless
them.</p>

<p><em>Oct. 17.</em>&mdash;Several of the elder boys, who had
fled from the plague with their parents, have been
with me since their return. My heart feels deeply
interested about them; yet I see not plainly my way.
I certainly never felt teaching in a school to be my
proper work, and now much less than ever; yet they
need instruction and desire it, and I think they are
attached to me. May the Lord give me a wise and
understanding heart, that I may rightly see the
service he requires of me. I much wish for the
counsel of my dear brethren at Aleppo; and perhaps
the Lord may soon send some of them to me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
<em>Oct. 18.</em>&mdash;I have heard to-day we are to have no
other Roman Catholic bishop in the room of him
who is dead; nor any French Consul, but only an
agent; this may take off many restraints; for the late
bishop had given out we were worse than either the
Mohammedans or Jews, and this had made a great
impression on his flock; for he was a very liberal
man, and therefore influential among them. However,
I very much question if things will now be
kept under the same restraint; so that should the
Lord lead me to open the school again, I should not
be surprised if many Roman Catholics came; for
they all acknowledge that our boys learned more
in three months than theirs in two years. The
new Pasha is likewise exceedingly desirous of cultivating
the closest friendship with our Resident,
who has most kindly offered me any aid he can
possibly lend me; and besides all this, the letters
I have this day received from England and Ireland,
shew me that my very dear friends have been
making provision for my school; so that altogether,
it seems to me the Lord&#8217;s will I should try
again; and in due time, when I am fit for other
service, he may raise up help that will take this
out of my hands. I desire to be ready to do any
work, however humble and contrary to my nature,
that I think the Lord appoints for me. I hear also,
that at Aleppo, the French intend only having an
Agent instead of a Consul; whereas, our government
has just sent a Consul out to Damascus
with an English merchant, and one to Aleppo, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
last year we had a Consul established at Trebizond.
I think Ali Pasha will do all in his power to
promote the steam navigation of these rivers; and
he is evidently a man of a very different character
from the Georgians who preceded him. They cherished
most of all the pride and pomp of Turkish
power, with all its inveterate prejudices, ignorance,
and narrowness of mind, so that if you had any
business of the least difficulty, you could never get
them to attend five minutes to it. But not so Ali
Pasha: he apprehends with facility; and you at
least have the satisfaction of knowing you are
understood. He has been at Trieste, and in
Hungary, and seems acquainted, to a limited
extent, with several of the public journals of
Europe. He dresses nearly as an European, and
his brother-in-law quite so, with the exception of
the hat; which is as yet very trying to the
genuine Asiatics, who look on their own dress
as that which it would be a sin to change. The
Pasha also seems perfectly indifferent to hoarding
money.</p>

<p>Things in the city are still very dear, arising
from the harvest of last year not having been
reaped, and various other causes. We have to
pay three times the usual price for most things;
but after such tremendous visitations as we have
suffered, we cannot expect that things can return
to their usual course in a day.</p>

<p><em>Oct. 22.</em>&mdash;I have had with me to-day a gentleman
who was formerly attached to Mr. Morier&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
mission in Persia. He fled from the plague at
Tabreez, and arrived at Kermanshah four days
after dear brother Pfander left it, who, by his conversations
in the caravan, had left so distinct an
impression, that he thought Mohammed a liar,
that when he reached Kermanshah, he found his
situation very difficult, nay dangerous, and he
was obliged hastily to quit it. He went to Hamadan,
and remained there three days in the house
of a priest, from whence he proceeded to Ispahan.
All the villages between Hamadan and
Ispahan are Armenian. The journey takes about
ten days. When he arrived at Ispahan, Abbas
Meerza being at Yezd, he went there, was treated
with great honour and respect, and a firman given
him to go where he liked: he returned to Ispahan,
and from thence went to Tabreez, which place he
reached before the plague broke out the second
time. This account makes me long to hear from
his own pen the course of the Lord&#8217;s dealings with
him. The same gentleman told me that the plague
in Tabreez was much worse the second than the first
time. Kermanshah is absolutely destroyed, and the
governor, a grandson of the king, is reported to have
collected from the property of the dead five lacs of
piasters. In Kourdistan, also, they say it has been
dreadful. In Saggas, Banah, and Sulemania, he says
the desolation is shocking. How wonderful God&#8217;s
visitations on these nations are; it makes the soul
that the Lord has appointed to be in the midst of
them often say, Lord, let thy kingdom come;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
yea, speedily, that thy people may know peace and
safety.</p>

<p>I have sent to see the number of the poor little
boys of my school that remain, and I find that they
amount to 25 out of 80, and that I may expect
near 30, should I get a master for them. I shall,
therefore, endeavour to accomplish this, the Lord
enabling me, and when I feel strong enough to
begin again.</p>

<p>I am very anxious about the dear N&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s at
Tabreez, from whom I have not received a
line. Abbas Meerza ordered large pits to be
dug for those who died of the plague, and when
they were full to have them covered in. The Ambassador,
and the English, Russian, and other
public functionaries, had fled, and from a packet
that came from Capt. Campbell, who has now the
charge of the mission since the death of Sir John
Macdonald, we know that he was safe up to a
late date.</p>

<p><em>Oct. 26.</em>&mdash;I was much struck with an account
which Mr. Swoboda, an Austrian merchant, gave me
to-day, of a conversation he had with the brother-in-law
of Ali Pasha. He said that now, in Stamboul,
the Christians went to the mosque, and the
Mohammedans to the Church; there was no difference.
How strikingly this shows the rapid progress
of that infidel spirit in these countries, which
is spreading in Europe; surely these then are such
signs as should keep us on the watch for our Lord.</p>

<p>Accounts have just come that the struggle has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
commenced at Damascus, that supreme seat of
bigotry, between the new and the old regime, and
it remains to be seen how it will terminate. I
already hear of one or two Roman Catholic boys,
who will now come to the school, who before,
during the life of the bishop, were afraid. My
health I also feel daily establishing; and that I
shall soon be able to enter on real labour again,
with the Lord&#8217;s blessing, I sincerely trust.</p>

<p><em>Oct. 27.</em>&mdash;The affairs of the city appear daily
more and more settling again; provisions are
coming in in abundance, and the price gradually
lowering. The roads also are becoming more open
and safe: for all these signs of tranquility we bless
the Lord and take courage, and trust we may yet
serve him in this land of our pilgrimage. Also
across the desert we hear the road is tranquil.</p>

<p><em>Oct. 28.</em>&mdash;To-day the Jew called whom I mentioned
in my journal of last year, as having
come to Mr. Pfander: he is a Jewish Rabbi,
who disbelieving Judaism, and possibly preferring
Christianity, seems to be in both without heart or
principle. He brought with him a Polish Jew,
who is the tailor of Ali Pasha. He saw Mr. Wolff
at Jerusalem, and speaks of him with high admiration.
The Rabbi told me he was reading with
him the German New Testament. May the Lord
send his holy fire on the altar of their hearts, that
they may really, heartily, and zealously enter into
his truth. If there is any gift my soul longs for,
it is to be able to speak to every one in his own
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
tongue wherein he was born, the wonderful works
of God; for want of this, in countries like this,
where you are surrounded by many different
languages, the heart gets overwhelmed with the
difficulties that seem to spread on every side; as,
for instance, with these Jews, they know little
Arabic, and I do not know German, and thus we
stand incapable of any such conversation as is likely
to search the heart.</p>

<p><em>Nov. 1.</em>&mdash;I have been reading with considerable
attention the remarks, or rather reflections,
of Jonathan Edwards, on the Life of Brainerd,
wherein he endeavours to recommend to the
Church of God, the <em>disinterested</em> and <em>unmercenary</em>
love of God, by which he means the love of him
for his abstract perfections apart from the consideration
of any personal interest or happiness
arising out of his especial love to his chosen. This
is all very fine and very philosophical, but in my
humble apprehension, most unscriptural. Does
God any where in Scripture, when appealing to
his chosen, or expostulating with them, argue on
the ground of his abstract perfections, or of his
especial love and distinguishing grace towards
them? Throughout the Old Testament this is the
controversy, not that they slighted his abstract
perfections, but disregarded his especial favour.
All the invitations to return, appeal to what
Edwards would call the selfish and mercenary
feelings. What! had not Moses respect unto the
recompense of reward; and in all the 11th of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Hebrews, where is this abstraction held up?
When our dear and blessed Lord exhorts to faithfulness,
watchfulness, devotion, does he represent
an abstraction as a motive, or without our own everlasting
participation with him with whom there is fulness
of joy for evermore. Paul thought it not mercenary
to think on his crown, or to encourage his
converts by the consideration, that present sorrow
for the Lord, works for them a far more exceeding
and eternal weight of glory. Again, eye hath
not seen nor ear heard the things which God hath
prepared for them that love him. Our blessed
Lord makes promises to whoever leaves father or
mother for his
sake,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
and John encourages his disciples,
by telling them that they were made sons of
God, and that they were to be made like their Lord;
he saw nothing debasing in this contemplation, but
instantly adds, &ldquo;he that hath this hope purifieth
himself even as he is pure.&rdquo; This is the promise
he hath promised even eternal life. In fact, the
doctrine of rewards, as an incentive to the saints,
prevails from one end to the other of the sacred
volume. The notion that a love which springs
from a sense of being beloved, must be selfish
and mercenary, is the greatest delusion imaginable.
It may be, and in proportion as its power
is really known and felt, is the most holy, self-denying,
pure, and devoted of all affections, an
affection that seeketh not her own, but the glory
of the object beloved. If Edwards would set up
dear D. Brainerd and his Indians in favour of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
abstract system, we may set up the Moravians
and their Esquimaux in favour of the other. But
why set up one set of worms and their conduct
against another set of worms and theirs, when we
have the record of God in our hands? Let us see
how our Heavenly Father proposes himself to our
love, confidence, and affections, and what incentives
he proposes as inducements to the sinner to
return, and the saint to persevere to the end, and
not attempt to be wise above that which is written.
That God is infinitely adorable in his abstract perfections
I am sure, though I cannot fathom these
abstract perfections, nor conceive of him but as revealed
in his blessed word in connection with his
chosen, and as personally exhibited by him who was
the brightness of his Father&#8217;s glory, and the express
image of his person, and this is not in abstractions
or apart from our happiness.</p>

<p>Again, when Edwards endeavours to prove it
is enthusiasm in an individual to imagine that
Christ, in an especial manner died for him, I
think he destroys the peculiar stimulus to devotedness,
which the doctrines of election in their
widest latitude, contain above the doctrines of
Armenianism, and he throws a coldness over all
the doctrines of grace. In Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, David, Daniel, and others, with the Apostles
of our Lord and Paul, it was both personal
and open, but because not equally open to the
rest of God&#8217;s children, I do not believe the holy
and blessed Spirit allows it to be less individual
and personal.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
If, however, his opponents were practically such
men as he describes, we cannot too deeply deplore
it; but he writes so much more like the
advocate of a sect, than an impartial enquirer
after truth, that, without a particular knowledge
of the case, one cannot help suspecting his picture
of those he is writing against, to be very highly
coloured. In fact, on the truth of God, it seems
philosophical declamation, without scriptural proof:
on the subject of his opponent, it is assertion in
the lump, concerning masses of individuals, without
proof or discrimination.</p>

<p><em>Nov. 4.</em>&mdash;We have here now at the head of
affairs, under the Pasha, one of those extraordinary
men who are capable of any thing good or bad.
Under Daoud Pasha he, for a long time, cruelly
oppressed the people, but more especially the Jews,
till at last a conspiracy was formed against him,
and by the influence of the father of the Serof
Bashee of the Pasha, who is one of the serofs,
or bankers,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
of the Sultan at Constantinople, an
order was procured for his being put to death.
Daoud Pasha did not execute this order, but imprisoned
him, and as he had been the instrument
of extorting money for him, he concluded he had
not failed at the same time to enrich himself. In
their endeavours to extort his money from him
they drew the bow-string so tight that they nearly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
strangled him: however he recovered: he told
them he had a certain sum of money, and where
it was, which Daoud Pasha had previously
agreed he should collect for himself. This his
rapacious miserable master had the meanness
to take from him. He had some friends who
exerted themselves to save his life; which was
spared. However, only a few days before the
entrance of Ali Pasha, orders were again issued
to put him to death, as he was detected holding
communication with those without the city; but
again intercession was made for him, and he was
again spared. He was instantly taken into
favour by Ali Pasha, on his entrance into the
town, who has made him his treasurer and accountant-general
(Musruff and Deftardar); and
in fact, the whole business of the Pashalic is in
his hands. He is at work night and day: till
after midnight he is engaged in business, and long
before dawn he is to be seen on horseback. He
never sleeps at home, but each night at a different
friend&#8217;s house, though the Pasha gave him the
best house (taken with all its accompaniments) in
Bagdad. When the Pasha heard that Major
Taylor&#8217;s house, which is on the river, had suffered
by the flood, he instantly gave it to him, and
he now intends occupying it. This man is not
only acquainted with all the internal affairs of the
city, but he is connected with all the tribes of Arabs
from Bussorah to Merdin; knows all their relations,
enmities, friendships, and divisions, external
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
as well as internal, and has ability and tact to
take advantage of them. He is also acquainted
with the agriculture of the country between the
two rivers, and greatly desires to advance and
improve it. What two such men as Ali Pasha
and he may effect, should the Lord allow them
to remain, it is impossible to conceive; but certainly
great changes. He has now his old enemy,
the Serof Bashee, in prison, and is bastinadoing
him to get money out of him. But his general carriage
to the inhabitants is much changed, though
he has now twice the authority, which clearly,
I think, manifests the altered temper of the government.
To the English, he is a most devoted
friend, and especially to the Resident, to whom
he feels he owes his life, for he is at once a firm
friend, and, I fear, an implacable enemy: one of
those men from whom if you can once extort the
assurance that you are safe, you may be at ease;
whereas, in general, from the Pasha downwards,
the more they assured you of your safety, the
more reason you felt you had to fear.</p>

<p><em>Nov. 7.</em>&mdash;I have been to-day calling on several
of the most respectable Roman Catholic merchants
of this place, who have, some of them,
repeatedly called on me; but, partly from want of
health, and partly from want of spirits, I have not
hitherto returned their visits. They received me
with the greatest kindness, and the opportunities
these visits afforded of bringing in God&#8217;s word as
the only standard of truth, I feel to be very
valuable. It seems perfectly new to them to have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the sentiments or conduct of themselves or
others measured by this holy and blessed book;
such a use they never in their lives saw made
of it, so that it strikes them exceedingly;
and the Lord&#8217;s spirit may make something here
or there rest on their hearts. I feel that the
door for my particular line of usefulness is opening,
and as I advance in the practical use of the
language, I have confidence the Lord will yet
shew me greater things than these.</p>

<p>There is a new Roman Catholic priest here, formerly
an Armenian. He has been trying to
see if he can get my school boys to come to him
if he opens a school: they have all refused;
and this strengthens me in my purpose of not
delaying the re-opening of mine longer than I
am obliged. Should I not be able to get a
master from Bussorah, for whom I have written,
there has been an Armenian with me, who
offers to come, a most respectable man; him,
therefore, I may consider, as ready, should
the other fail. Thus, the Lord provides. With
my English class, I purpose, the Lord willing,
to begin after another fortnight. My greatest
difficulty will be I fear, to obtain an Arabic
teacher; the mortality among the Mollahs
has been enormous. Here then I shall end
for the present, I fear this too long, and, in
many respects, tedious, journal of the last
five months, as the messenger goes to-morrow
or the day after.</p>

<h2>NOTES.</h2>


<p>Mr. Groves having so strongly expressed his condemnation
of Mr. Erskine&#8217;s view of Divine Truth, in pages
102, 103, and 104 of his Journal, the Editor, who believes
Mr. Groves to be in error regarding the extent
of the Atonement, has felt it to be a duty not to
allow his statements to pass unaccompanied with a
plain declaration of the truth. The following Notes
on some of the principal points touched upon by Mr.
Groves, have been contributed by a brother who bears
him much love, the Rev. A. J. Scott, of Woolwich, not
so much with any view of detailed discussions of
Mr. Groves&#8217;s positions, as simply to exhibit truth, as
the best antidote to error.</p>

<p>Mr. Groves has referred to the effects of system. One
of the most important of these is, that opposite systems
lead men to take such opposite views of the evidence itself
by which the truth of the conflicting opinions must be
tried. Of this he here furnishes an instance, in saying
so strongly that the &ldquo;sovereignty of God&#8217;s government,
and the individuality of God&#8217;s election,&rdquo; are &ldquo;represented
by the Apostles as the most overwhelming reasons for unlimited
devotion to his service, who has thus chosen us.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
Many of the very passages, doubtless, to which he would
turn for the establishment of this assertion, would be enjoyed
by others, as proofs how available is the general &ldquo;kindness
of God our Saviour towards <em>man</em>,&rdquo; as an argument
for loving and serving him. When Paul persuades the
Ephesians to &ldquo;walk in love as Christ also hath loved <em>us</em>,
and hath given himself for
<em>us</em>;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
when Peter recommends
to his brethren patient meekness in suffering, by the consideration
that &ldquo;Christ also suffered for <em>us</em>, the just for the
unjust,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
the power of this over the mind of one man depends
on his understanding by &ldquo;<em>us</em>&rdquo; the fallen world; and of
another, on its reminding him only of distinguishing personal
obligations to sovereign election. Now, suasives to
holiness, or what are felt as such, as they continually recur
in Scripture, produce on a devout mind a much deeper
conviction of the truth of the doctrines from which they
are derived, than a formal assertion can. When, by the
same expressions, one man is habitually carried to this,
another to that, view of the Divine character, and each
experiences, that in what he sees, there is a practical tendency
towards the state of the heart and form of life at
which he aims as good: this becomes to each, as instances
accumulate, a far stronger reason than bare propositions,
could be for growing in confidence, that the belief which
thus impresses him is indeed the truth of God.</p>

<p>And one accustomed to observe the effects of system
will not wonder that expressions like those above cited,
still less that those in which Christ is spoken of as having
&ldquo;loved <em>the church</em> and given himself for <em>it</em>,&rdquo; should thus
come to be regarded as containing an argument for a selective
atonement. It is by such a doctrine being perceived in
them, that they practically impress the feelings of many.
And yet, in truth, how are they inconsistent with the universal
love of God and propitiation of Christ? Of course,
where a common benefit is received, its efficacy, as a motive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
to grateful returns, is limited to those who recognize
and value it. A patriot has delivered millions of ignorant,
suspicious, ungrateful countrymen. His services are to
be used as an argument for joining in some effort for his
honour; and those who acknowledge and bless his exertions
are especially addressed, and reminded that &ldquo;he loved
<em>you</em>, laboured for <em>you</em>, achieved happiness for <em>you</em>.&rdquo;
Would this contain even an insinuation, that they were the
exclusive objects of his disinterested ardour? In such an
address not only would the common benefit be mentioned
peculiarly as a good bestowed on themselves; but their acknowledgment
of it, and their distinguishing susceptibility
to the feeling of its worth, would be referred and appealed
to, as reasons why that was looked for and demanded of
them, which from others might be as justly asked, but not
so naturally expected. Such appeals are the apostolic epistles
to the churches, as contrasted with their proclamation
of Christ to the world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><strong>NOTE B, page <a href="#Page_103">103</a>.</strong></p>

<p>The moral condition of man, his seeing no desirableness
in the object presented to him by the Gospel, Mr.
Erskine shews, at great length, to be the grand obstacle
to his enjoying it. The capacity to know and believe, he
indeed conceives to bring with it the capacity to enjoy.
But if a change in the moral state is necessary in receiving
the truth, this surely obviates the objection that such truth
would be unpalatable and uninfluential to those whose
moral state is <em>unchanged</em>.</p>

<p>Our business, however, is not with Mr. E. but with
the truth of the matter. Mr. Groves&#8217; remarks refer to the
<em>nature</em> of regeneration, and to the <em>necessity</em> of a change in
the affections, in order to man&#8217;s appreciating the object
presented to him in the Gospel: these he considers as objections
to the doctrine that the simple knowledge and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
belief of that object are &ldquo;the cause of spiritual life in
the unregenerate;&rdquo; and he uses the analogy of food, which
he says, is not the cause of life, although it be the support
of it. Certainly the contemplation of Jesus is not the
cause, but it is the commencement and exercise of spiritual
life, which needs no commencement of a distinct kind from
its subsequent functions. As to the analogy of food, it
will be seen whether the language of Scripture bears us
out in making the same distinction between the source and
the sustenance of spiritual, as of natural life.</p>

<p>What, indeed, is meant to be asserted? Is it, that men
have life in them <em>first</em>, to capacitate them to eat the flesh
and drink the blood of the Son of Man? This seems to be
said: but Himself hath said, &ldquo;Except ye eat the flesh and
drink the blood of the Son of Man, ye have <em>no</em> life in you.&rdquo;
Not life then without the food, or before the food, but <em>by</em>
the food. This banquet <em>is</em> to be spread before the dead.
Thus only shall any live. Is spirit and life in men first
from another source, and then do they take and profit by
his words? But &ldquo;the entrance of his words <em>giveth</em> light,&rdquo;
and that light is life. &ldquo;The words that I speak unto you,&rdquo;
says the Lord, &ldquo;<em>they</em> are spirit, and they are life&rdquo;: and that
spirit, the spirit of his words, he tells us it is that &ldquo;quickeneth&rdquo;
or produceth life. Is there, then, no need for regeneration?
Surely there is: but it does not follow that the
principle of regeneration is one, and that of faith another to
be superadded to it. &ldquo;We are born,&rdquo; says Peter, &ldquo;not of
corruptible seed, but of the word of God, which liveth and
abideth for ever;&rdquo; adding, in very remarkable language,
&ldquo;This is the word which by the Gospel is preached unto
you.&rdquo; An explanation which removes all doubt as to the
meaning of James, when he says, &ldquo;Of his own will begat
he us with the word of truth,&rdquo; that is, according to Peter,
with the Gospel preached. John, in like manner, tells us,
that &ldquo;whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world,&rdquo;
and if we ask, what is born of God? Is it a principle antecedent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
and necessary to faith? He answers, It is faith
itself. &ldquo;This is the victory that overcometh the world,
even our faith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><strong>NOTE C, page <a href="#Page_104">104</a>.</strong></p>

<p>The question is not whether the scheme of salvation is
merely reconcilable with divine love and justice, but how
it constitutes the grand proof and manifestation of these
attributes, and in general, of the perfections of God. In
it he undertakes to shew himself worthy of love, and thus
to win our love to himself. Any other means to that end
than such as should prove his own worthiness, He could
not use. One may confer a benefit on an individual from
a thousand various motives, of which one only may be
morally right. In event of any of the others having
prompted the action, the benefactor may be regarded with
gratitude, but then it is either because the motive is mistaken
for the nobler one, or the gratitude is a mere reflected
selfishness. As an example of the latter sort, the
Jews, in the days of the Son of Man upon earth, had a
love to God, a zeal for God, founded on their conviction
of his partiality for their people. They regarded him as
the God of the Jews only, and not also of the Gentiles.
Its fruits were, their carrying the Lord to the brow of the
hill to destroy him, because he reminded them of Naaman
and the widow of Sarepta, as preferred to objects of bounty
among their own people; and their endeavouring to tear
Paul in pieces when he spake of a commission given him by
Jesus to the Gentiles. They were indeed zealous, the apostle
bears them witness in the Holy Ghost, and fully believed
in God&#8217;s sovereign election of their nation. There is yet a
zeal like their&#8217;s&mdash;let us beware of it.</p>

<p>It will not do to represent the Gospel scheme of salvation
as not only <em>leaving</em>, but involving, the moral character
of God in difficulty; and then to say we can still believe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
him holy, just, and good notwithstanding. The atonement
was designed to prove and establish these attributes: to be
the ground of our confidence in them, and of our love to God
because of them. We are not to believe in them in spite
of the plan of redemption; but, because of the plan of redemption.
The words of John, &ldquo;we love him because he
first loved us,&rdquo; and &ldquo;herein is the love of God manifested
towards us, because he sent his Son into the world that we
might live through him,&rdquo; imply that the believer&#8217;s delight
in the essential excellence of God (which delight alone
is divine love) springs out of the display of that excellence
in the cross of Christ. An atonement for all, arising out of
love to all, proves that it is indeed justice that inflicts vengeance
on the impenitent; not partial, personal hatred,
not indifference, not cruelty. A limited atonement, just
because it gives no proof that they are beloved&mdash;gives no
proof that nothing else than justice could have punished
them. It gives, on the other hand, no proof that forgiving
love has been that which saved the elect, as it is to an arbitrary
distinction it teaches them to look as the ultimate
cause of their hope. I care not to be told that they acknowledge
love in their salvation notwithstanding. I repeat,
the redemption is to <em>prove</em> the divine character, not
merely to leave us the possibility of believing it.</p>

<p>Finally, This scheme obliges to believe that Jesus has
broken the law, and transgression of the law is sin. This
he assuredly did, if he loved not all mankind as himself.
It is an ignorant answer to say, that for him to break the
law was not sin. To break the moral law, and to be a
sinner, are not things arbitrarily put together; they are
two names for the same thing. It is worse to say he need
not keep the law because he was God. The law is the transcript
of the character of God: opposition to it is opposition
to that character. Made of woman, besides, he was
made under the law. All praises of his goodness and
moral perfection are so many varied expressions for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
completeness with which he kept the law. And oh! indeed,
what part of it so peculiarly his own, as to love his
neighbour as himself?</p>

<p>I say, therefore, again, to limit the divine love, to limit
the atonement, the grand expression of that love, is to limit
the love of Christ, and thus to make Christ a sinner. He
that hath seen him hath seen the Father. No moral difference
surely is so great as that between a breaker and a
keeper of the law of love. What a moral difference, then,
between the character of a God manifested in the one form
and in the other.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>


<p>The following letters are added, because they contain
some interesting details of the Lord&#8217;s dealings with
this our dear brother, which are not contained in the
Journal. And the reader will observe, that the last letter
is of a later date than the conclusion of the Journal.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;" class="smcap">Bagdad</span>, <em>Oct. 15th, 1831.</em></p>

<p>The Lord has just raised me up from a typhus fever,
which, for the last month, has been pressing a little hard
on my strength, but more on my spirits. The loss of my
dearest Mary was so deeply felt by my poor desolate heart,
that, at times, I bore up with difficulty; but the Lord
shewed me that my sorrow was so selfish, so earthly, so
unworthy of his love, and poured in besides such hopes
and prospects as to my future work, that sustained and
comforted me.</p>

<p>I send with this a Journal of four months, from which
you will see what has been passing amongst us.</p>

<p>I have lately received many letters from my dear brethren
at Aleppo, and I think either Mr. Cronin or Mr. and Mrs.
Parnell will come to me the first opportunity, which will
be an unspeakable relief to my mind; for I long for some
one to whom I may unburthen my soul; for although my
Lord is always near, yet, as I see in Paul, so I find in myself,
that the society of Christian brethren and sisters, so
long as we are in the flesh, will always afford a sweet consolation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
I feel that Jesus meant his Church to be a body, not
isolated members. We have each a little ministry essential
to the happiness and building up of the mystical body&mdash;that
there should be no schism, but that all the members might
love and care one for the other.</p>

<p>This place has been governed by Georgians, Apostate
Christians, just as the Memelukes, another race of Apostate
Christians, formerly governed Egypt. The Sultan
has extirpated the first, and now the second, and the Janissaries
who had a somewhat similar origin, have, at Stamboul,
experienced a similar fate. Those of the Georgians
who have had their lives spared will be sent to Stamboul.
It is certainly the design of Ali Pasha and the Sultan, to
make many changes here, and I wait to see the Lord&#8217;s
goings. It appears to me probable that most important
openings may be afforded by these changes to our operations
in these quarters: but I have seen such things these
last twelve months, that my soul rests only upon God, to see
how he will move. His ways are so deep, so out of sight,
that what we think likely, He, in a month, brings to
nothing, and yet in his own good time, will bring the most
wonderful and unexpected things to pass. I have never
ceased to bless God for the sweet assurance of his unchanging
love, for the sake of Him who is our life, our dear and
blessed Jesus. He has supplied me, I know not how, in
the midst of famine, pestilence, and war; and though I
have heard from none in England for more than a year,
especially from those that supply my wants, the Lord has
not suffered me to want, or to be in debt, and though the
necessaries of life have amounted to almost twenty times
their value during our late trials, he has not suffered me
personally to be much affected by it. His loving-kindness
and care have been wonderful.</p>

<p>Of all the political and religious agitations of England,
I have heard only whispers; but I am very anxious to
receive a full account. For many months all communication
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
has been entirely cut off; not a message has come
though the road has now been open a month.</p>

<p>The Lord has graciously allowed me to see the signs of
spiritual life in three souls of late, through my instrumentality;
and as the Lord gives me utterance, I trust I shall
be able to speak to many others. The difficulties of the
language are fading away one by one. I had occasion to
translate a public document from the new Pasha to the
Resident at Bussorah, concerning business of the utmost
importance and secrecy, in which the Resident, who is a
most competent judge, tells me I succeeded fully.</p>

<p>I often think my dear friends in England will be sadly
discouraged at the Lord&#8217;s dealings with our mission: so
difficult is it to act faith in dark seasons. However, should
their faith and hope fail, the Lord will either raise up
others or find me some little occupation by which I may
live. His goodness in the way of provision has been so
wonderfully manifested, that my heart feels quite easy
that He will find a way for the support of his servant.</p>

<p><em>Oct. 24.</em>&mdash;Since writing the above, I have received your
letter of March last, by Bombay. Oh! how welcome it
came! Oh! how it refreshed me! Surely there exists
not in the world a more loving little Church than these dear
believers amongst whom the Lord has brought us into one
fellowship. I assure you, widely as I am separated from
this beloved family in body, I am truly one with them in
spirit, and am greatly refreshed by the springs of the Lord&#8217;s
grace, that run amongst them.</p>

<p>I received several letters with yours, from England and
Ireland; and the zeal of those dear friends who had provided
for my school, made me finally determine, the Lord
willing, and supplying me masters, to try again. I have
sent one of the bigger boys round, and I trust, with new
boys, I shall begin with thirty.</p>

<p>The Bible Society have sent me a number of Books
with a generous letter, nobly generous as to the principles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
of distribution. And there appears a prospect of great
changes which may open a much wider door of usefulness
here than I now have: I had thoughts of leaving this place,
but the Resident entreats me not to go, and promises, should
any thing happen to me, that he will be a father to my dear
boys, till he can send them by an unexceptionable opportunity
to England. All these things make me feel that the
Lord still means me to stay here, and see his salvation.&mdash;Infidelity
is making open and manifest strides amongst the
Mohammedans on the other side of the desert, and in
Persia, and we shall soon see the same spirit that is working
in Europe working here: amidst these tempests, I sometimes
think &#8217;tis hard to live. Yet, my dear friend, it is
sweet to live hardly for Jesus.</p>

<p>After all my sufferings and all my sorrows, my heart is
not discouraged. We have first the clods of the language
to break up, then to prepare the ground, then to sow the
seed, and through all to look for the precious showers
from on high, and lastly for the fruit. Let us, then, like
the husbandman patiently wait.</p>

<p>The evil of the pressure of the world on the soul I feel
as fully as you can do; not the luxurious worldliness of
Europe, yet the pursuit of the language, and the absolute
uncongeniality of all around, disorders the soul greatly.
During Mary&#8217;s life, or rather pilgrimage, I never wanted
spiritual refreshment; I sometimes used to fear it stole
away those hours that the language and other calls demanded;
but now whilst I am sensibly proceeding in the
language, my soul knows not that animated joy of heavenly
communion with the saints on earth which I once enjoyed.
Jesus still is near, still comforts and supports; but yet I
feel he meant his Church to be a body. The miserable
substitute of man&#8217;s ordination for the Holy Ghost&#8217;s, has
destroyed the true unison and order of the Church of
Christ, by substituting that which is artificial for that
which is of God; by appointing man to be the artificer of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
work God alone can accomplish. Now the Church presents
a monstrous aspect, a great mis-shapen head called
the clergy, and as mis-shapen a body called the laity. All
the members being crowded into the head, and leaving the
body without office or service, this did not the Spirit.
How blessed it is among all these disorders to know that
the Lord cares for his own, and will keep them as the apple
of his eye, watching day and night lest any hurt them.
Thus, were we preserved when we little thought it, by our
Shepherd&#8217;s care. There is something, I think, in this
view of the body being thus composed of members of
various orders, various services, from the most minute to
the most important, all tending to the one great end, the
glory of the only Head and the Church&#8217;s glory in him, that
greatly comforts the weak. When the Lord first led me
to feel interested in the service of his cause abroad, I
framed to myself some <em>beau-ideal</em> of a missionary that if I
now entertained would destroy all happiness. Since the
Lord has led me to see how truly low my place is in his
holy blessed body, amidst all this humiliation he makes me
feel happy in the thought I am a member, though embracing
little that pride would lead to aim at. If I am but
allowed to minister to my dear and holy brethren on the
other side of the desert I shall feel happy and thankful.
Sometimes I am overwhelmed with the condescension that
he should allow me to feel part of his mystical body, though
so weak so useless.</p>

<p>On the subject of baptism all the dear brethren at Aleppo
have finally agreed and been baptized; thus the last little
difference that I know between us is closed. How gracious
the Lord is!</p>

<p>The Lord has laid his hand heavily on them. Dear
Newman is but just raised from a bed of sickness. The
schoolmaster whom they brought is so unwell, that dear
John Parnell and his wife have taken him for the change
of air to the water&#8217;s side; they too have both been very ill.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
Mrs. Cronan is daily getting weaker and weaker, so they
are prevented joining me now from ill health, as before
from the disturbances, and in a short time Mrs. Parnell
expects to be confined, which will still delay them, as well
as the expectation of a friend or two from England and
Ireland. Should the Lord not remove these difficulties
to their coming before the spring, and my Bibles and Testaments
arrive from Bussorah, I purpose, the Lord willing,
perhaps even in about two months, going by the way of
Mosul, Merdin, Diarbekr, Orsa, and Beer to Aleppo, there
to consult and to be refreshed, should the Lord graciously
smile upon us, and in my way to distribute his word and
see the state of the places above mentioned.</p>

<p>When Mr. Newman was at the worst, and they had
given up all hopes of him, they anointed him with oil
according to the 14th of the 5th of James, and prayed over
him, and the Lord had mercy on them, yea, and on me also,
and restored him. It seems to me truly scriptural, and if
the Church of Rome has perverted it to superstitious ends,
ought we therefore to cast aside so plain a precept? By
many it would be called plain popery, but this we must
bear. I can feel a happiness in submitting to these directions
of the Lord by the Spirit; they seem to us little, but
surely whatsoever is of sufficient importance for the Spirit
to command or direct, is sufficiently important for us worms
to obey. With regard to miracles my mind is not at
present prepared to embrace them fully: but this I do feel
that the Apostle Paul, in Corinthians 12 and 14, when
speaking of supernatural gifts for the edifying the Church
and doing the work of God, points them out as things to be
desired and prayed for then, and if they were desired to
be prayed for then, why not now? I look on the
argument from experience in the churches as of no weight,
for unless it can be proved the churches have received
faith on these powers, their not possessing the power is
according to the whole analogy of faith. That distinguishing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
between apostolic times and present times is to my
mind so dangerous a principle, and puts into the hands of
any one so disposed, a sword that seems to me to reach the
very vitals of the Gospel.</p>

<p>I would have you pray for me, especially that Christ may
be in me daily, my glorious loving Lord and satisfying portion,
whose presence can make even this waste howling
wilderness like the garden of Eden. Little did I think
how poor I was in the anointed Lamb of God till he
stripped me bare, and left me here to stand months alone
with himself, and then I saw how much of that apparent
love and zeal I felt flowed from human fountains. I bless
his name, he left me yet a little while untainted to cheer,
support, and comfort me, but my stature, my dear friend,
I pray I may not again, mistake nor think I am approaching
towards manhood when a very child in spiritual
growth. When surrounded by all the love and kindness
I experienced amongst you, encouraged by your sympathy
and prayers, those thousand weaknesses I since have felt
I hardly know the smart of. Amidst dangers, sorrows,
and death I have walked for many months; and these
scenes have tried the very foundation, yet it was most
gracious of the Lord, when he let the plague reach me and
laid me on my couch to give me the sweetest comfort from a
full assurance of his favour and forgiveness, when there
was as I thought but a step between me and death. Yet
whilst he has never left me without the sense of being his,
He has shewn me how much I have to aim at, how earnestly
to desire to be filled with all his fulness.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span style="margin-left: 20em;" class="smcap">Bagdad</span>, <em>Dec. 25th, 1831</em>.
</p>

<p>Your most kind and welcome letter arrived this day,
together with several others from my beloved friends in
England, all by Bombay. It does, indeed, truly refresh
my heart, to hear of the Lord&#8217;s love to you all. Do you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
not praise God for these dear brothers and sisters he has
given us? How rich we are in our sweet little church; a
more loving, holy, and blessed little family cannot surely
be found upon earth. Unworthy as I am to be one of
you, yet I bless God that I am one. My heart is running
over with thankfulness at the Lord&#8217;s goodness to you
all, and to me through you, and be not discouraged because
I am blasted, and my bough no longer green, as it once
was, the Lord has yet dealt most bountifully with me. In
all but my dear Mary&#8217;s place my path is opening again. I
have hired one schoolmaster, and expect another. My
English boys are most zealous and attached: my prospects
of Bible circulation in Persia much opening. To the Jews
here I have sold all my Hebrew Bibles, at about 3s. 6d.
each: this is more to them than 12s. would be in England,
and though it seems little, it answers an end of getting
God&#8217;s word amongst them. I had an Armenian bishop with
me the other day, asking for Persian Testaments to send to
Ispahan; and a Roman Catholic merchant has promised to
take a parcel for me to Teheran, and to distribute them there.
Besides these there are others whom I hope to find subservient
to this end. For some days I had been making preparations
to cross the desert, in order to consult with my
dear brethren there about our future measures; but when
I came to put together all the items of expense, I found I
had not money enough, so I gave up the plan of going with
my dear boys, and proposed waiting till Major Taylor
came, and leaving them in the Residency, under his and
dear Mrs. Taylor&#8217;s kind care, to go alone. Your letter,
however, has relieved all my pecuniary difficulties, and we
shall now go altogether or remain together. The love of
you all in thinking of and caring for me quite overwhelms
me, as I see it to be the Lord&#8217;s love in and through you all.
He not only feeds us in this wilderness, but also provides
for the school, so as to overwhelm me with a sense of his
care over the most unworthy of his servants. My wonder
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
is, how it is possible for me to love him so little. Since
I left England, this is the first purpose I really thought
desirable, that the want of sufficient money has put a stop
to; and this you see but for a moment; not but that I can
get money at any time, but I am determined not to borrow
money till my affairs come to the utmost straits, and then
only for the simplest necessaries.</p>

<p>I have received a letter from England, which gives me a
painful impression of the state of most of the religious societies.
Indeed, I fear they cannot stand on their present
basis. May the Lord gently lead them right. The spirit
of compromise to gain the world has ruined all; yet are
there some sweet spirits amongst them. I would rather
have the love that could love amidst a thousand faults, than
the zeal that will endure but one. Some, I know, would
call this a sickly sort of feeling, but the more I see of their
fiery condemnation and sarcastic scorn, the more I am sure
it is not of Christ. It is only turning the truth of God into
a sort of chimney for the escape of nature&#8217;s pride and passion.</p>

<p>My second plan for going to Aleppo has been defeated
by my having heard a very bad account of the Arab Sheikh
of the Caravan. The Lord graciously gave me an opportunity
of seeing his true character before I was alone involved
with him in the desert, where, indeed, you are
fearfully at their mercy, and where they have so many
means of oppressing you.</p>

<p><em>Dec. 29.</em>&mdash;How gracious it was of the Lord to send me
your letter, just before expense became inevitable, for
either for the journey, or for shutting up; you must expend
money, as during the time of the plague raging, you can
obtain nothing, not even bread, and, if you could, you
would be afraid to use it. What unspeakable peace it
brings to the soul to have Jesus to look to, and to know
that his eye is not averted, though all seems dark. Blessed
doctrines of grace! how they comfort when the soul
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
would sink under sin: to know that for Christ&#8217;s sake we
are pardoned. Yea, though we have played the harlot
with many lovers, the Lord has restored us, and decked
us for his bride against the day of his espousals. Oh what
a day, the day of the marriage supper of the Lamb will be,
may our hearts be waiting for it, with holy expectation.
Pray for me that my faith fail not, nor my Lord&#8217;s love
even appear little in my eyes; but that I may always be
enabled to say, &ldquo;Though he slay me yet will I trust in
him.&rdquo; If it be, that all my hopes finish, may his holy
blessed will be done. I often wonder how he keeps up my
hope as he does; but still I do hope even against hope:
and I would call upon you, and all my dear friends,
brethren, and sisters in Christ, to rejoice with me at the
prospect of that blessed day which is dawning upon us,
when we shall see our beloved as he is, and dwell with him
for ever, when our vile bodies will be changed and made
like unto his glorious body, when the whole number of
his elect family will be completed, and we shall reign with
him in glory.</p>

<p><em>Jan. 16, 1832.</em>&mdash;My dear little boy, Frank, is just laid
down in a fever, so I cannot now go to Aleppo. Thus
the Lord frustrates all our plans and purposes.</p></div>

And yet what security is afforded by a present
abatement of the visitation? In Glasgow, cholera was regarded
as departing, and all but departed. The number of cases

the deaths not seldom to between one and two hundred a

This is the Armenian whose history I gave a little account
of before, as the son-in-law of the richest merchant in Baku,
who has given up all the prospects of his connection with his
father-in-law, which are very considerable, to endure afflictions
with the people of God. This young Armenian is another
proof of the immense importance of having those to bear testimony
to the power of the Spirit&#8217;s work in regenerating the soul
in the image of him that created it, from among themselves. The
people can see in him the contrast between the past and the
present man. They have also a knowledge of the peculiar
modes of thinking and feeling among those with whom they
have been educated, and been in the closest terms of intimacy
with from their infancy, that they cannot have with foreigners.</p></div>

Hillah is a small town on the river Euphrates, a little
below the ruins of Babylon. It was built in the year 495
of the Hegira, or 1115 of the Christian era, in a district
called by the natives El Aredh Babel; its population does
not exceed between 6 and 7000, consisting of Arabs and
Jews, there being no Christians, and only such Turks as
are employed in the Government. The inhabitants bear a
very bad character. The air is salubrious, and the soil
extremely fertile, producing great quantities of rice, dates,
and grain of different kinds, though it is not cultivated to
above half the degree of which it is susceptible,&mdash;See Mr.
Rich&#8217;s Memoirs on the Ruins of Babylon.&mdash;<em>Editor.</em></p></div>

<em>Karakoosh</em> is a small town within twelve miles of
Mosul, containing about nine hundred houses, inhabited
entirely by Syrian or Jacobite Christians, many of whom
are become Roman Catholics. They speak Syriac, but
so corrupted, that it is with great difficulty they understand
the Syriac of the Scriptures. There are seven
churches, four of which belong to the Roman Catholics,
and the remainder to the Jacobites. The road between
Karakoosh and Mosul, passes through the striking remains
of Nineveh.</p></div>
